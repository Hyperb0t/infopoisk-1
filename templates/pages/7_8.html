7.7 Gains from trade

economic rentA payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or reservation option). See also: reservation option.gains from exchangeThe benefits that each party gains from a transaction compared to how they would have fared without the exchange. Also known as: gains from trade. See also: economic rent.Pareto efficientAn allocation with the property that there is no alternative technically feasible allocation in which at least one person would be better off, and nobody worse off.

Remember from Unit 5 that when people engage voluntarily in an economic interaction, they do so because it makes them better off: they can obtain a surplus called economic rent. The total surplus for the parties involved is a measure of the gains from exchange or gains from trade. We can analyse the outcome of the economic interactions between consumers and a firm just as we did for Angela and Bruno in Unit 5. We judge the total surplus, and the way it is shared, in terms of Pareto efficiency and fairness.
We have assumed that the rules of the game for allocating Cheerios and cars to consumers are:


A firm decides how many items to produce, and sets a price.


Then individual consumers decide whether to buy.


These rules reflect typical market institutions for the allocation of consumer goods, although we might imagine alternativesmaybe a group of people who wanted cars could get together to produce a specification, then invite manufacturers to tender for the contract.
In the interactions between a firm like Beautiful Cars and its consumers, there are potential gains for both, as long as the firm is able to manufacture a car at a cost less than the value of the car to a consumer. Recall that the demand curve shows the willingness to pay (WTP) of each of the potential consumers. A consumer whose WTP is greater than the price will buy the good and receive a surplus, since the value to her of the car is more than she has to pay for it.

total surplusThe total gains from trade received by all parties involved in the exchange. It is measured as the sum of the consumer and producer surpluses. See: joint surplus.

Similarly, the marginal cost curve shows what it costs to make each additional car (if you start at Q = 0, the marginal cost curve shows how much it costs to make the first car, then the second, and so on). And if the marginal cost is lower than the price, the firm receives a surplus too. Figure 7.13 shows how to find the total surplus for the firm and its consumers, when Beautiful Cars sets the price to maximize its profits.

Gains from trade


When the firm sets its profit-maximizing price P* = $5,440 and sells Q* = 32 cars per day, the 32nd consumer, whose WTP is $5,440, is just indifferent between buying and not buying a car, so that particular buyers surplus is equal to zero.














A higher WTP


Other buyers were willing to pay more. The 10th consumer, whose WTP is $7,200, makes a surplus of $1,760, shown by the vertical line at the quantity 10.














What would the 15th customer have been willing to pay?


The 15th consumer has WTP of $6,800 and hence a surplus of $1,360.














The consumer surplus


To find the total surplus obtained by consumers, we add together the surplus of each buyer. This is shown by the shaded triangle between the demand curve and the line where price is P*. This measure of the consumers gains from trade is the consumer surplus.














The producer surplus for the 20th car


Similarly, the firm makes a producer surplus on each car sold. The marginal cost of the 20th car is $2,000. By selling it for $5,440, the firm gains $3,440, shown by the vertical line in the diagram between P* and the marginal cost curve.














The total producer surplus


To find the total producer surplus, we add together the surplus on each car produced: this is the purple-shaded area.














The marginal car


The firm obtains a surplus on the marginal car: the 32nd and last car is sold at a price greater than marginal cost.





Consumer surplus, producer surplus, profit

The consumer surplus is a measure of the benefits of participation in the market for consumers.
The producer surplus is closely related to the firms profit, but it is not quite the same thing. Producer surplus is the difference between the firms revenue and the marginal costs of every unit, but it doesnt allow for the fixed costs, which are incurred even when Q = 0.
The profit is the producer surplus minus fixed costs.
The total surplus arising from trade in this market, for the firm and consumers together, is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.


In Figure 7.13, the shaded area above P* measures the consumer surplus, and the shaded area below P* is the producer surplus. We see from the relative size of the two areas in Figure 7.13 that in this market, the firm obtains a greater surplus share.
As in the voluntary contracts between Angela and Bruno, both parties gain in the market for Beautiful Cars, and the division of the gains is determined by bargaining power. In this case the firm has more power than its consumers because it is the only seller of Beautiful Cars. It can set a high price and obtain a high share of the gains, knowing that consumers with high valuations of the car have no alternative but to accept. An individual consumer has no power to bargain for a better deal because the firm has many other potential customers.
Pareto efficiency

Pareto efficientAn allocation with the property that there is no alternative technically feasible allocation in which at least one person would be better off, and nobody worse off.Pareto improvementA change that benefits at least one person without making anyone else worse off. See also: Pareto dominant.consumer surplusThe consumers willingness to pay for a good minus the price at which the consumer bought the good, summed across all units sold.producer surplusThe price at which a firm sells a good minus the minimum price at which it would have been willing to sell the good, summed across all units sold.deadweight lossA loss of total surplus relative to a Pareto-efficient allocation.

Is the allocation of cars in this market Pareto efficient? The answer is no, because there are some consumers who do not purchase cars at the firms chosen price, but who would nevertheless be willing to pay more than it would cost the firm to produce them. In Figure 7.13 we saw that Beautiful Cars makes a surplus on the marginal car (the 32nd one). The price is greater than the marginal cost. It could produce another car, and sell it to the 33rd consumer at a price lower than $5,440 but higher than the production cost. This would be a Pareto improvement: both the firm and the 33rd consumer would be better off. In other words, the potential gains from trade in the market for this type of car have not been exhausted at E.
Suppose the firm had chosen instead point F, where the marginal cost curve crosses the demand curve. This point represents a Pareto-efficient allocation, with no further potential Pareto improvementsproducing another car would cost more than any of the remaining consumers would pay. Figure 7.14 explains why the total surplus, which we can think of as the pie to be shared between the firm and its customers, would be higher at F.

Unexploited gains from trade


The firms profit-maximizing price and quantity is at point E, but there are unexploited gains from trade. The firm could make one more car and sell it to the 33rd consumer for more than it would cost to produce.














A Pareto-efficient allocation


Suppose the firm chooses F instead, selling Q0 cars at a price P0 equal to the marginal cost. This allocation is Pareto efficient: making another car would cost more than P0, and there are no more consumers willing to pay that much.














A higher consumer surplus


The consumer surplus is higher at F than at E.














A higher total surplus


The producer surplus is lower at F than at E, but the total surplus is higher.














Deadweight loss


At E, there is a deadweight loss equal to the area of the white triangle between Q = 32, the demand curve and the MC curve.




The total surplus would be higher at the Pareto-efficient point (F) than at point E. Consumer surplus would be higher, because those who were willing to buy at the higher price would benefit from the lower price, and additional consumers would also obtain a surplus. But Beautiful Cars will not choose F, because producer surplus is lower there (and you can see that it is on a lower isoprofit curve).
Since the firm chooses E, there is a loss of potential surplus, known as the deadweight loss. On the diagram it is the triangular area between Q=32, the demand curve, and the marginal cost curve.
It might seem confusing that the firm chooses E when we said that at this point it would be possible for both the consumers and the firm to be better off. That is true, but only if cars could be sold to other consumers at a lower price than to the first 32 consumers. The firm chooses E because that is the best it can do given the rules of the game (setting one price for all consumers). The allocation that results from price-setting by the producer of a differentiated product like Beautiful Cars is Pareto inefficient. The firm uses its bargaining power to set a price that is higher than the marginal cost of a car. It keeps the price high by producing a quantity that is too low, relative to the Pareto-efficient allocation.
But evaluating whether the outcome is Pareto efficient does not mean the rules of the game must be kept unchanged. If there is a technically feasible allocation in which at least one person is better off and nobody is worse off, then E is not Pareto efficient. As a thought experiment, imagine that the rules of the game were different, and the firm could charge separate prices to each buyer, just below the buyers willingness to pay. Then the firm would definitely sell to any potential buyer whose willingness to pay exceeded the marginal cost, and as a result all mutually beneficial trades would take place. It would produce the Pareto-efficient quantity of cars.
To set individual prices in this way (called perfect price discrimination, an extreme form of price discrimination), the firm would need to know the willingness to pay of every buyer. In this hypothetical case the deadweight loss would disappear. The firm would capture the entire surplus: there would be producer surplus, but no consumer surplus. We might think this unfair, but the market allocation would be Pareto efficient.

Exercise 7.5 Changing the rules of the game

Suppose that Beautiful Cars had sufficient information and so much bargaining power that it could charge each consumer, separately, the maximum they would be willing to pay. Draw the demand and marginal cost curves (as in Figure 7.14), and indicate on your diagram:
      
the number of cars sold
the highest price paid by any consumer
the lowest price paid
the consumer and producer surplus


Can you think of any examples of goods that are sold in this way?
Why is this not common practice?
Some firms charge different prices to different groups of consumersfor example, airlines may charge higher fares for last-minute travellers. Why would they do this and what effect would it have on the consumer and producer surpluses?
Suppose a competition policy has changed the rules of the game. How could this give consumers more bargaining power?
Under these rules, how many cars would be sold?
Under these rules, what would the producer and consumer surpluses be?



Question 7.13 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

Consumer surplus is the difference between the consumers willingness to pay and what they actually pay.
Producer surplus equals the firms profit.
Deadweight loss is the loss incurred by the producer for not selling more cars.
All possible gains from trade are achieved when the firm chooses its profit-maximizing output and price.


This is correct: to be more precise, each consumer receives a surplus equal to the difference between the WTP and the price, and consumer surplus is the sum of the surpluses of all consumers.
Producer surplus is the difference between the firms revenue and its marginal costs. This is not the same as profit, because it doesnt account for the fixed costs of production. The profit is the producer surplus minus the fixed costs.
The deadweight loss is the loss of potential total surplus due to the firm producing below the Pareto-efficient level. It is the sum of the surplus losses of both the consumers and the producer.
All possible gains would be achieved at the Pareto-efficient output level. But the profit-maximizing choice of a firm producing a differentiated good is not Pareto efficient.
