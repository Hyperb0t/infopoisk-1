5.11 Angela and Bruno: The moral of the story
Angelas farming skills and Brunos ownership of land provided an opportunity for mutual gains from exchange.
The same is true when people directly exchange, or buy and sell, goods for money. Suppose you have more apples than you can consume, and your neighbour has an abundance of pears. The apples are worth less to you than to your neighbour, and the pears are worth more to you. So it must be possible to achieve a Pareto improvement by exchanging some apples and pears.
When people with differing needs, property and capacities meet, there is an opportunity to generate gains for all of them. That is why people come together in markets, online exchanges or pirate ships. The mutual gains are the piewhich we call the surplus.
The allocations that we observe through history are largely the result of the institutions, including property rights and bargaining power, that were present in the economy. Figure 5.11 summarizes what we have learned about the determination of economic outcomes from the succession of scenarios involving Angela and Bruno.

Technology and biology determine whether or not they are able to mutually benefit, and the technically feasible set of allocations (Section 5.5). If Brunos land had been so unproductive that Angelas labour could not produce enough to keep her alive, then there would have been no room for a deal.
For allocations to be economically feasible, they must be Pareto improvements relative to the parties reservation options, which may depend on institutions (such as Angelas survival rations from the government (Section 5.7) or legislation on working hours (Section 5.10)).
The outcome of an interaction depends on peoples preferences (what they want), as well as the institutions that provide their bargaining power (ability to get it), and hence how the surplus is distributed (Section 5.10).

The story of Angela and Bruno provides three lessons about efficiency and fairness, illustrated by Figure 5.10, to which we will return in subsequent units.

When one person or group has power to dictate the allocation, subject only to not making the other party worse off than in their reservation option, the powerful party will capture the entire surplus. If they have done this, then there cannot be any way to make either of them better off without making the other worse off (point D in the figure). So this must be Pareto efficient!
Those who consider their treatment unfair often have some power to influence the outcome through legislation and other political means, and the result may be a fairer distribution in their eyes or ours, but may not necessarily be Pareto efficient (point F). Societies may face trade-offs between Pareto-efficient but unfair outcomes, and fair but Pareto-inefficient outcomes.
If we have institutions under which people can jointly deliberate, agree on, and enforce alternative allocations, then it may be possible to avoid the trade-off and achieve both efficiency and fairnessas Angela and Bruno did through a combination of legislation and bargaining between themselves (point H).
