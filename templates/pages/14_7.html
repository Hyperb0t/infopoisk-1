14.6 Fiscal policy: How governments can dampen and amplify fluctuations
There are three main ways that government spending and taxation can dampen fluctuations in the economy:

The size of government: Unlike private investment, government spending on consumption and investment is usually stable. Spending on health and education, which are the two largest government budget items in most countries, does not fluctuate with capacity utilization or with business confidence. These kinds of government spending stabilize the economy. As we have also seen, a higher tax rate dampens fluctuations because it reduces the size of the multiplier.
The government provides unemployment benefits: Although households save to smooth fluctuations in income, few households save enough (that is, self-insure) to cope with an extended period of unemployment. So unemployment benefits help households to smooth consumption. Other programs to redistribute income to the poor have the same smoothing effect.
The government can intervene: It can intervene deliberately to stabilize aggregate demand using fiscal policy.


fiscal policyChanges in taxes or government spending in order to stabilize the economy. See also: fiscal stimulus, fiscal multiplier, aggregate demand.co-insuranceA means of pooling savings across households in order for a household to be able to maintain consumption when it experiences a temporary fall in income or the need for greater expenditure.hidden actions (problem of)This occurs when some action taken by one party to an exchange is not known or cannot be verified by the other. For example, the employer cannot know (or cannot verify) how hard the worker she has employed is actually working. Also known as: moral hazard. See also: hidden attributes (problem of).

Could workers insure privately against job loss? There are also three reasons why the private market fails, and therefore governments provide unemployment insurance in the form of unemployment benefits:

Correlated risk: In a recession, job loss will be widespread. This means that there will be a surge in insurance claims across the economy and a private provider may be unable to pay out on the scale required. It also means co-insurance among a group of neighbours or family members may be of limited use, as the need for help may arise in many households at the same time.
Hidden actions: As we saw in Unit 12, the insurance company cannot observe the reason for the job loss so it would have to insure the employee against a firm cutting back employment due to lack of demand, as well as the worker being fired for inadequate work. This creates a moral hazard, because a well-insured person is expected to make less of an effort on the job.
Hidden attributes: Suppose you learn that your firm is in difficulty, but the insurance company does not. This is another example of asymmetric information. You will therefore buy insurance when you learn of the likely closure of the firm, and it will be provided at good rates because the insurance company does not know that you are likely to make a claim on them. Workers who know their firm is performing well will not buy insurance. The hidden attributes problem will be true about individuals (hardworking or lazy), as well as firms (successful or failing). The good prospects (those who enjoy working hard, for example) will shun the insurance and the insurer will be left with those likely to face the extra risks of losing their job.

The system of unemployment benefits is part of the automatic stabilization that characterizes modern economies. We have already seen another automatic stabilizer: a proportional tax system reduces the size of the multiplier and dampens the business cycle.

moral hazardThis term originated in the insurance industry to express the problem that insurers face, namely, the person with home insurance may take less care to avoid fires or other damages to his home, thereby increasing the risk above what it would be in absence of insurance. This term now refers to any situation in which one party to an interaction is deciding on an action that affects the profits or wellbeing of the other but which the affected party cannot control by means of a contract, often because the affected party does not have adequate information on the action. It is also referred to as the hidden actions problem. See also: hidden actions (problems of), incomplete contract, too big to fail.hidden attributes (problem of)This occurs when some attribute of the person engaging in an exchange (or the product or service being provided) is not known to the other parties. An example is that the individual purchasing health insurance knows her own health status, but the insurance company does not. Also known as: adverse selection. See also: hidden actions (problem of).asymmetric informationInformation that is relevant to the parties in an economic interaction, but is known by some but not by others. See also: adverse selection, moral hazard.automatic stabilizersCharacteristics of the tax and transfer system in an economy that have the effect of offsetting an expansion or contraction of the economy. An example is the unemployment benefits system.paradox of thriftIf a single individual consumes less, her savings will increase; but if everyone consumes less, the result may be lower rather than higher savings overall. The attempt to increase saving is thwarted if an increase in the saving rate is unmatched by an increase in investment (or other source of aggregate demand such as government spending on goods and services). The outcome is a reduction in aggregate demand and lower output so that actual levels of saving do not increase.fallacy of compositionMistaken inference that what is true of the parts (for example a household) must be true of the whole (in this case the economy as a whole). See also: paradox of thrift.

In our list, the third role of government in dampening fluctuations is the use of fiscal policy in deliberate stabilization policies: an increase in government spending or cuts in taxation to support aggregate demand in a downturn; or trimming spending and raising taxes to rein in a boom. It can be cumbersome to have these fiscal policy measures approved by a parliament, which has power over budgetary decisions, which is one reason why stabilization policy is often handled through monetary, rather than fiscal, policy. But fiscal policy can also play an important role in stabilization, as we now consider, especially in particularly large downturns.
The paradox of thrift and the fallacy of composition
By comparing a household with the economy as a whole, we better understand the nature of an increase in the governments deficit in a recession. Faced with a household budget deficit, a family worried about their falling wealth cuts spending and saves more. We saw exactly this behaviour in Figure 14.8 when households increased their savings in 1929. Keynes showed that the wisdom of family precautionary saving does not apply to the government when the economy is in a recession.
Compare the attempt to save more by a single household and by all households in the economy simultaneously. Think of a single household cutting expenditures and putting its additional savings in a sock. The money is in the sock for when the household decides it is wise to spend it.
Now, assume that all households cut expenditures and put additional savings in their socks. Assuming nothing else in the economy changes, the additional saving causes lower aggregate consumption spending in the economy. What happens? From the previous section, we can model this as a fall in autonomous consumption, c0: the aggregate demand curve shifts down. The economy moves through the multiplier process to a lower level of output, income, and employment. The aggregate attempt to increase savings led to a fall in aggregate income, which is known as the paradox of thrift. The fact that what is true for one part of the economy is not true of the whole economy is known as the fallacy of composition.
A single household can increase its savings if it anticipates bad luck, and the saving will be there if it is unluckyfor example, if someone becomes ill or loses a job. However, if every household does this when the economy is in a recession, this behaviour causes the bad luck: more people lose their jobs. The reason is that in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together. My spending is your income. Your spending is my income.
What can be done? The government can allow the automatic stabilizers to operate and help absorb the shock. In addition, it can provide an economic stimulus (such as a temporary increase in government spending or a temporary cut in taxation) until business and consumer confidence return and the private sector regains its willingness to spend. Budget deficits rise, but this avoids a deep recession, as Keynes realized.

fiscal stimulusThe use by the government of fiscal policy (via a combination of tax cuts and spending increases) with the intention of increasing aggregate demand. See also: fiscal multiplier, fiscal policy, aggregate demand.

When a government cuts taxes or increases government spending G in a recession, it is called a fiscal stimulus. The aim is to counteract the fall in aggregate demand from the private sector. A tax cut is intended to encourage the private sector to spend more, while an increase in G is a direct addition to aggregate demand. Figure 14.11a shows how an increase in G can offset a decline in private consumption, such as that described by the paradox of thrift. Like an exogenous increase in investment, the rise in G operates via the multiplier, so the increase in output will typically be greater than the increase in G.

Suppose that the government then increases spending, from G to G, in order to counteract the decline in aggregate demand. AD shifts back up and the economy moves to point C.





Great economists John Maynard Keynes

John Maynard Keynes (18831946) and the Great Depression of the 1930s changed the course of economic thought. Until then, most economists had seen unemployment as the result of some kind of imperfection in the labour market. If this market worked optimally it would equate the supply of, and demand for, workers. The massive and persistent unemployment in the decade prior to the Second World War led Keynes to look again at the problem of joblessness.
Keynes was born into an academic family in Cambridge, UK. He studied mathematics at Kings College, Cambridge and then became an economist and prominent follower of the renowned Cambridge professor, Alfred Marshall. Before the First World War, Keynes was a world authority on the quantity theory of money and the gold standard, and held conservative views on economic policy, arguing for a limited role of government. But his views would soon change.
In 1919, following the end of the First World War, Keynes published The Economic Consequences of the Peace, which opposed the Versailles settlement that ended the war.2 This book instantly made him a global celebrity. Keynes rightly argued that Germany could not pay large reparations for the war, and that an attempt to make Germany do this would help provoke a worldwide economic crisis. In 1925, Keynes opposed Britains return to the gold standard, arguing that this policy would lead to a contraction of the economy. In 1929 there was a financial crash and global crisis. The Great Depression followed. In 1931 Britain was driven off the gold standard.
In response to these dramatic events, Keynes explained that the orthodox monetary policies required by the gold standard would worsen the depression, and that the world needed policies to increase aggregate demand. In 1936, he published The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in which he set out an economic model to explain these views.3 The General Theory immediately became world famous, particularly for the idea of the multiplier, which is explained in this unit. In The General Theory, Keynes reasoned that if interest rates were already very low, then fiscal expansion would be necessary to alleviate depression. Such was the lasting influence of his work that the initial response in many countries to the global economic crisis of 2008 was to apply such Keynesian policies.
During the Second World War, Keynes turned to postwar reconstruction, determined to ensure that the mistakes that followed the First World War would not be repeated. In 1944, with Harry Dexter White of the US, he led an international conference at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire that resulted in the creation of a new international monetary system, managed by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF. The Bretton Woods system was designed to avoid the mistakes Keynes had unsuccessfully warned against in the aftermath of the First World War, and to ensure that a country that was in recession (and had balance of payments difficulties) would not need to follow the contractionary policies required by the gold standard. A country like this could use fiscal policy to pursue full employment, while at the same time it could devalue its exchange rate to encourage exports, reduce imports, and achieve a satisfactory balance of payments position.
Keynes led a remarkably varied life. He was an academic, a senior civil servant, owner of the New Statesman magazine, financial speculator, chairman of an insurance company, and member of the British House of Lords. He was also the founder of the Arts Council of Great Britain and chairman of the Covent Garden Opera Company. He was married to the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova and was a key member of the Bloomsbury Group, a remarkable circle of artistic and literary friends in London, which included the novelist Virginia Woolf.
In 1926, in a pamphlet entitled The End of Laissez-Faire,4 he wrote:

For my part I think that capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight, but that in itself it is in many ways extremely objectionable. Our problem is to work out a social organization which shall be as efficient as possible without offending our notions of a satisfactory way of life.


How governments can amplify fluctuations
Keynes argument refers to the cell in the bottom right of Figure 14.12 at the end of this section: poor policymaking that amplifies the business cycle.

government budget balanceThe difference between government tax revenue and government spending (including government purchases of goods and services, investment spending, and spending on transfers such as pensions and unemployment benefits). See also: government budget deficit, government budget surplus.government budget deficitWhen the government budget balance is negative. See also: government budget balance, government budget surplus.government budget surplusWhen the government budget balance is positive. See also: government budget balance, government budget deficit.

Sometimes a government chooses to raise taxes or cut spending during a recession because it is concerned about the effect of a recession on its budget balance. The government budget balance is the difference between government revenue less transfers, T, and government spending, G, that is, (T  G). As we have seen, if the economy is in recession, government transfers, like unemployment benefits, rise while tax revenues fall, so the governments budget balance deteriorates and may become negative.
When the governments budget balance is negative, this is called a government budget deficitgovernment spending on goods and services, including investment spending, plus spending on transfers (such as pensions and unemployment benefits) is greater than government tax revenue. A government budget surplus is when tax revenue is greater than government spending. To summarize:

Budget in balance: G = T
Budget deficit: G > T
Budget surplus: G < T

The worsening of the governments budgetary position in a recession is part of its stabilizing role. Conversely, when the government chooses to override the stabilizers to reduce its deficit, this may amplify fluctuations in the economy.
Suppose a government tries to improve its budgetary position in a recession by cutting its spending. This, like a tax increase, is referred to as austerity policy. Follow the analysis in Figure 14.11b to see how austerity policy can reinforce a recession by further reducing aggregate demand.












Figure 14.11b 
Government austerity can worsen a recession.
        















Goods market equilibrium


The economy starts at point A in goods market equilibrium, at which aggregate demand is equal to output.














The economy moves into recession


This occurs after a fall in consumer confidence, reducing c0. The aggregate demand line shifts downward and the economy moves from point A to point B.














Austerity policy


Suppose that the government then reduces spending from G to G, in a bid to offset the deterioration of its budget balance. The recession then feeds back to raise government transfers and reduce tax revenue.




Does this argument mean that governments should never impose austerity in order to reduce a fiscal deficit? Nojust that a recession is not a wise time to do it. Running government deficits under the wrong economic conditions can be harmful. In a well-designed policy framework, there will be constraints on government action, as we will see in Section14.8.

The table in Figure 14.12 summarizes the lessons so far. The first row gives examples of how household behaviour may either smooth or disrupt the economy. The terms negative and positive feedback are used to refer to dampening and amplifying mechanisms in the business cycle.

Exercise 14.4 Spending cuts in a recession
Assume the government is initially in budget balance.

Does the governments budget balance improve, deteriorate, or remain unchanged if the government cuts its spending in a recession, ceteris paribus? To answer this question, use the example in Figure 14.11b. Assume the budget was in balance at point A. Once at B, the government cuts G in an attempt to improve its budget balance. Assume there are no unemployment benefits and a linear tax.
Evaluate the governments policy.



Question 14.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

Maintaining fiscal balance in a recession helps to stabilize the economy.
Automatic stabilizers refer to the fact that economic shocks are partly offset by households smoothing their consumption in the face of variable income.
The multiplier on a fiscal stimulus is higher when the economy is functioning at full capacity.
A fiscal stimulus can be implemented by raising spending to directly increase demand, or by cutting taxes to increase private sector demand.


If the government maintains fiscal balance then it is not offsetting the decline in private demand.
Automatic stabilizers refer to government policies that smooth household disposable incomes, such as taxes and unemployment benefits.
The multiplier as we have defined it so far assumes that there is spare capacity in the economy. It will be low or zero if there is little or no spare capacity.
A rise in G increases aggregate demand directly while a cut in taxes can increase C and/or I, representing increased private sector demand.
