1.3 Historys hockey stick: Growth in income


If you have never have seen an ice-hockey stick (or experienced ice hockey) this shape is why we call these figures hockey-stick curves.

A different way of looking at the data in Figure 1.1a is to use a scale that shows GDP per capita doubling as we move up the vertical axis (from $250 per capita per year to $500, then to $1,000, and so on). This is called a ratio scale and is shown in Figure 1.1b. The ratio scale is used for comparing growth rates.
By the growth rate of income or of any other quantity, for example population, we mean the rate of change:

If the level of GDP per capita in the year 2000 is $21,046, as it was in Britain in the data shown in Figure 1.1a, and $21,567 in 2001, then we can calculate the growth rate:

Whether we want to compare levels or growth rates depends on the question we are asking. Figure 1.1a makes it easy to compare the levels of GDP per capita across countries, and at different times in history. Figure 1.1b uses a ratio scale, which makes it possible to compare growth rates across countries and at different periods. When a ratio scale is used, a series that grows at a constant rate looks like a straight line. This is because the percentage (or proportional growth rate) is constant. A steeper line in the ratio scale chart means a faster growth rate.
To see this, think of a growth rate of 100%: that means the level doubles. In Figure 1.1b, with the ratio scale, you can check that if GDP per capita doubled over 100 years from a level of $500 to $1,000, the line would have the same slope as a doubling from $2,000 to $4,000 dollars, or from $16,000 to $32,000 over 100 years. If, instead of doubling, the level quadrupled (from say, $500 to $2,000 over 100 years), the line would be twice as steep, reflecting a growth rate that was twice as high.

Before 1800 we have fewer data points


For the period before 1800 we have less information about GDP per capita, which is why there are fewer data points in that part of the figure.

For each country the data points shown at the previous step have been joined with straight lines. Before 1800 we cant see how living standards fluctuated from year to year.

China and India


The kink for China and India happened in the second half of the twentienth century. GDP per capita actually fell in India during British colonial rule. You can see that this is also true of China during the same period, when European nations dominated Chinas politics and economics.

Compare growth rates in China and Japan


The ratio scale makes it possible to see that recent growth rates in Japan and China were higher than elsewhere.

In some economies, substantial improvements in peoples living standards did not occur until they gained independence from colonial rule or interference by European nations:

India: According to Angus Deaton, an economist who specializes in the analysis of poverty, when 300 years of British rule of India ended in 1947: It is possible that the deprivation in childhood of Indians was as severe as that of any large group in history. In the closing years of British rule, a child born in India could expect to live for 27 years. Fifty years on, life expectancy at birth in India had risen to 65 years.
China: It had once been richer than Britain, but by the middle of the twentieth century GDP per capita in China was one-fifteenth that of Britain.
Latin America: Neither Spanish colonial rule, nor its aftermath following the independence of most Latin American nations early in the nineteenth century, saw anything resembling the hockey-stick upturn in living standards experienced by the countries in Figures 1.1a and 1.1b.

We learn two things from Figures 1.1a and 1.1b:

For a very long time, living standards did not grow in any sustained way.
When sustained growth occurred, it began at different times in different countries, leading to vast differences in living standards around the world.

An entertaining video by Hans Rosling, a statistician, shows how some countries got richer and healthier much earlier than others.
Understanding how this occurred has been one of the most important questions that economists have asked, starting with a founder of the field, Adam Smith, who gave his most important book the title An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.5

Great economists Adam Smith

Adam Smith (17231790) is considered by many to be the founder of modern economics. Raised by a widowed mother in Scotland, he went on to study philosophy at the University of Glasgow and later at Oxford, where he wrote: the greater part of the professors have given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.
He travelled throughout Europe, visiting Toulouse, France where he claimed to have very little to do and thus began to write a book in order to pass away the time. This was to become the most famous book in economics.
In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Smith asked: how can society coordinate the independent activities of large numbers of economic actorsproducers, transporters, sellers, consumersoften unknown to each other and widely scattered across the world? His radical claim was that coordination among all of these actors might spontaneously arise, without any person or institution consciously attempting to create or maintain it. This challenged previous notions of political and economic organization, in which rulers imposed order on their subjects.
Even more radical was his idea that this could take place as a result of individuals pursuing their self-interest: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest, he wrote.
Elsewhere in the Wealth of Nations, Smith introduced one of the most enduring metaphors in the history of economics, that of the invisible hand. The businessman, he wrote: intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.
Among Smiths insights is the idea that a significant source of prosperity is the division of labour or specialization, and that this in turn is constrained by the extent of the market. Smith illustrated this idea in a famous passage on the pin factory by observing that ten men, each fully specialized in one or two of 18 distinct operations, could produce close to 50,000 pins a day. But if they had all wrought [pins] separately and independently they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.
But such an enormous number of pins could only find buyers if they were sold far from their point of production. Hence specialization was fostered by the construction of navigable canals and the expansion of foreign trade. And the resulting prosperity itself expanded the extent of the market, in a virtuous cycle of economic expansion.
Smith did not think that people were guided entirely by self-interest. Seventeen years before The Wealth of Nations, he had published a book about ethical behaviour called The Theory of Moral Sentiments.6
He also understood that the market system had some failings, especially if sellers banded together so as to avoid competing with each other. People in the same trade seldom meet together, he wrote, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public; or in some contrivance to raise prices.
He specifically targeted monopolies that were protected by governments, such as the British East India Company that not only controlled trade between India and Britain, but also administered much of the British colony there.
He agreed with his contemporaries that a government should protect its nation from external enemies, and ensure justice through the police and the court system. He also advocated government investment in education, and in public works such as bridges, roads, and canals.
Smith is often associated with the idea that prosperity arises from the pursuit of self-interest under free market conditions. However, his thinking on these issues was far more nuanced than he is given credit for.


Exercise 1.4 The advantages of ratio scales
Figure 1.1a used a conventional scale for the vertical axis, and Figure 1.1b used a ratio scale.

For Britain, identify a period of time when its growth rate was increasing and another period in which its growth rate was roughly constant. Which figure did you use, and why?
Identify a period during which GDP per capita was shrinking (a negative growth rate) faster in Britain than in India. Which figure did you use and why?



Question 1.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
The GDP per capita of Greece was $22,494 in 2012 and $21,966 in 2013. Based on these figures, the growth rate of GDP between 2012 and 2013 (to two decimal places) was:

2.40%
2.35%
2.35%
0.24%


The GDP per capita decreased by $528. To find the growth rate divide by the 2012 GDP per capita $22,494 (and not the 2013 GDP per capita $21,966).
Greeces GDP per capita decreased between 2012 and 2013, resulting in a negative growth rate.
The GDP per capita changed by $21,966  $22,494 = $528. The growth rate of GDP per capita is given by this change as a percentage of the 2012 figure: $528/$22,494 = 2.35%.
The decrease in the GDP per capita of $528 is 2.35% of $22,494 and not 0.235%.



Question 1.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Imagine that the GDP per capita of a country had doubled every 100 years. You are asked to draw both linear and ratio scale graphs that plot GDP on the vertical axis, and the year on the horizontal axis. What will be the shapes of the curves?



Linear scale graph
Ratio scale graph








An upward-sloping curve with increasing slope (called convex shape)
An upward-sloping straight line








An upward-sloping straight line
A straight horizontal line








An upward-sloping straight line
An upward-sloping curve with decreasing slope (called concave shape)








An upward-sloping convex curve
An upward-sloping convex curve





Note: Linear scale graphs are normal graphs in which the difference in height between 1 and 2, and the difference between 2 and 3, would be the same on the vertical axis.

An upward-sloping straight line on a ratio scale graph means that the growth rate of the GDP per capita is constant. An upward-sloping convex curve on a linear scale graph means that the GDP per capita increases by a greater and greater amount in absolute terms over time, consistent with a positive constant growth rate.
An upward-sloping straight line on a linear scale graph means that the GDP per capita increases by the same amount every year. A straight horizontal line on a ratio scale graph means that the GDP per capita is constant over the years.
An upward-sloping straight line on a linear scale graph means that the GDP per capita increases by the same amount every year. An upward-sloping concave curve on a ratio scale graph means that the growth rate decreases each year. Here the growth rate is constant.
An upward-sloping convex curve on a ratio scale graph means that the growth rate increases each year. Here the growth rate is constant.
