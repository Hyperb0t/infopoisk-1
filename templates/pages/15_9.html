15.8 Monetary policy
We use the Phillips curve and the policymakers indifference curves to look at shocks and policy responses. Before doing so, we need to recall how monetary policy affects the economy.
As we saw, we can explain why people might dislike rising or volatile inflation, but most people have no reason to object to a (slowly) rising price level. In fact, many central banks around the world have policies to target an inflation rate of 2%. They either set this objective for themselves, or the government sets the objective for them. It means they are doing best if prices rise each year by a rate close to 2%.
When central banks target an inflation rate of 2%, the best answer to the question why does the price level rise at 2%? becomes because the central bank makes it happen.
As we first saw in Unit 10, when inflation is forecast to be higher or lower than this, the central bank can take action to adjust the level of aggregate demand and employment so as to steer the economy toward a 2% target.
When they can, central banks use changes in the policy interest rate as their monetary policy instrument to stabilize the economy. Monetary policy relies on the central bank being able to control interest rates, and on changes in interest rates influencing aggregate demand. For example, higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money to spend. It is important to remember that it is the real interest rate that affects spending. But when the central bank sets the policy rate, it sets it in nominal terms. So by setting a particular nominal rate it is aiming for a specific real interest rate, and it therefore takes account of the effect of expected inflation (see our Einstein at the end of this section for more about the Fisher equation).
The transmission of monetary policy
Figure 15.14 shows how the Bank of England views the transmission of monetary policy from its interest rate decision to aggregate demand and inflation in normal situationsthat is, when the interest rate is its policy instrument.

Look at the boxes in the first column of Figure 15.14.
Market interest rates

policy (interest) rateThe interest rate set by the central bank, which applies to banks that borrow base money from each other, and from the central bank. Also known as: base rate, official rate. See also: real interest rate, nominal interest rate.lending rate (bank)The average interest rate charged by commercial banks to firms and households. This rate will typically be above the policy interest rate: the difference is the markup or spread on commercial lending. Also known as: market interest rate. See also: interest rate, policy rate.

In Unit 10 we explained that, although the central bank sets the policy interest rate, commercial banks set the market interest rate (also referred to as the bank lending rate) that households and firms pay when they take out loans. When the central bank cuts the policy rate to stimulate spending, the market interest rate typically falls by approximately the same amount. To set the policy rate, the central bank will therefore work backwards, starting with its desired level of aggregate demand:

It will estimate a target for the total aggregate demand, Y, to stabilize the economy, based on the labour market equilibrium and the Phillips curve.
It will then estimate the real interest rate, r, which will produce this level of aggregate demand, based on shifting the aggregate demand line into the desired position in the multiplier diagram.
Finally it calculates the nominal policy rate, i, that will produce the appropriate market interest rate.

Think about how a fall in the market interest rate affects the decision to build a new house. The cost of taking out a loan to finance the construction of the house will fall, so as the interest rate falls, investors will consider more new housing projects to be financially viable. Through this channel, a lower policy rate will raise investment by businesses and households, and a higher policy rate will lower it (see Figure 14.9).
Asset prices
This refers to financial assets in the economy such as government bonds and shares issued by companies. When the central bank changes the interest rate, this has a ripple effect through all the interest rates in the economy, from mortgage rates to the interest rates on 20-year government bonds. As we saw in the Einstein in Unit 10, when the interest rate goes down, the price of the asset goes up. So a fall in interest rates will be expected to feed through to spending, because households who own the assets will feel wealthier.
Profit expectations and confidence
In Units 13 and 14 we stressed the importance of profit expectations and confidence for the investment decisions of firms. When setting the interest rate, the central bank tries to build confidence through consistent policymaking and good communication with the public. If it lowers the policy rate and explains its reasoning, this can lead firms to expect higher demand, who will therefore increase investment. Similarly, if it increases the confidence of households that they will not lose their jobs, then they may also increase their spending.
Exchange rate
We return in the next section to the way monetary policy affects aggregate demand through the exchange rate channel: this will shift the aggregate demand line by changing net exports, (X  M).
In the multiplier model of aggregate demand, the transmission channels from the policy rate to domestic aggregate demand are reflected in the investment function (including new housing), which shifts when the real interest rate changes. We write this function I(r). The expectations and asset price effects will shift the investment function as we saw in Figure 14.5, and the consumption function, by changing c0 (Figure 14.11a).
In the multiplier diagram, the intercept of the aggregate demand line with the vertical axis includes investment, which means that the line shifts whenever the interest rate is changed by the central bank, or when business confidence changes. If the central bank is trying to boost the economy in a business cycle downturn, it cuts the interest rate. By signalling its willingness to support growth, the central bank also aims to influence the confidence of decision-makers in firms and households and help shift the economy from the low-investment equilibrium illustrated in the coordination game in Figure 13.17 to a high-investment equilibrium.
Figure 15.15 shows how monetary policy can be employed to stabilize the economy following a downturn caused by a drop in consumption (for example, as a result of a fall in consumer confidence). Follow the steps in the analysis in Figure 15.15 to see how a cut in the real interest rate brings the economy out of recession. In this example, we assume that the decline in the interest rate to r only increases investment and not autonomous consumption, which remains at c0.

Goods market equilibrium


The economy starts in goods market equilibrium at point A.














A recession


Consumption then falls, which shifts the aggregate demand line down and the economy enters a recession, moving from point A to point B.














Monetary policy


To stabilize the economy, the central bank stimulates investment by lowering the real interest rate from r to r. This policy shifts the aggregate demand curve upward, pulling the economy out of recession and back to its starting point.




A warning
Using simple diagrams like Figure 15.15 may give the impression that the central bank is able to stabilize the economy by accurate diagnosis of a shock and precise intervention with a change in the interest rate. This is far from the case! The economy emits all kinds of noisy signals and it is difficult to decide, for example, whether a downturn is a temporary blip or signifies a long-term weakness. The models we use help us to organize our thinking about the causal links in the economy and what policies might be warranted. They do not give a complete recipe for effective stabilization.
Figure 15.15 shows how the central bank could attempt to counteract a recession. But how should the central bank react to a consumption boom? It needs the opposite policy. A boom will shift the aggregate demand line upwards, so the central bank must pursue policies that dampen demand and return the aggregate demand line back to its starting point. The central bank can do this by raising the interest rate.
But why would it want to curtail a boom? From the Phillips curve, we know that a boom leads to higher inflation, and, if expectations adjust to past inflation, to rising inflation. High and rising inflation imposes costs on the economy.
We have shown how monetary policy can be used by the central bank to stabilize the economy in a recession. The government could also have played this role by cutting taxes, or by boosting spending.
Why monetary policy, and what are its limits? Fiscal policy is complicated to adjust and inflexible. Instead, to keep aggregate demand close to the level it desires, the central bank can adjust the interest rate up and down by small amounts month-by-month.
There are two important limitations, however, to the usefulness of monetary policy in stabilization:

The short-term nominal interest rate cannot go below zero: But this is the central banks policy instrument.
A country without its own currency does not have its own monetary policy.

The zero lower bound
If the policy interest rate were negative, people would simply hold cash rather than put it in the bank, because they would have to pay the bank for holding their money (thats what a negative interest rate means). This is the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. It matters because when the economy is in a slump, a nominal interest rate of zero may not be low enough to achieve a sufficiently low real interest rate to drive up interest-sensitive spending and get the economy going again. Remember that the real interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate minus inflation. So the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate means that the lower bound on the real interest rate is equal to minus the inflation rate. Policy interest rates were reduced close to zero in many economies after the global financial crisis, but this was not enough to restore aggregate demand to the labour market equilibrium. For this reason, some economists argue that countries with inflation targets of 2% should raise them to 4% in order to allow real interest rates to become more negative in a slump.5

zero lower boundThis refers to the fact that the nominal interest rate cannot be negative, thus setting a floor on the nominal interest rate that can be set by the central bank at zero. See also: quantitative easing.quantitative easing (QE)Central bank purchases of financial assets aimed at reducing interest rates on those assets when conventional monetary policy is ineffective because the policy interest rate is at the zero lower bound. See also: zero lower bound.

This is also why economies that were badly hit by the global financial crisis introduced a new kind of monetary policy called quantitative easing (QE). The aim of QE is to increase aggregate demand by buying assets, even when the policy interest rate is zero.
How is QE supposed to work?

The central bank buys bonds and other financial assets: It creates additional base money for this purpose.
This raises demand for bonds and other financial assets: So the central bank shifts the demand curve for those assets to the right, which pushes up the price. This also decreases the yield and interest rate on bonds, as explained in the Einstein in Unit 10.
This boosts spending: Particularly on housing and consumer durables, because both the cost of borrowing and return to holding financial assets has gone down.

So, even when the interest rate the central bank directly controls is stuck at zero, it can use QE to try to reduce the interest rate on a variety of other financial assets. The empirical evidence suggests that the effects of QE in boosting aggregate demand are positive but small.
No national monetary policy

common currency areaA group of countries that use the same currency. This means there is just one monetary policy for the group. Also known as: currency union.

Monetary policy may not be available to a country. Members of the Eurozone gave up their own monetary policy when they joined the currency union. The Eurozone is called a common currency area (or currency union) because all the members use the euro. This means there is just one monetary policy for the whole of the Eurozone. The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt sets the policy interest rate, because it controls the base money used by all banks in the Eurozone. This interest rate may be more appropriate for some members than for others. In particular, after the financial crisis, unemployment was low and falling in Germany but in the southern Eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, it was high and rising fast. There were many complaints that the ECBs monetary policy remained too restrictive for too long for the needs of the latter countries.

Exercise 15.7 Fiscal or monetary policy?
Think back to the discussion of the government finances in Unit 14.

In the event of a financial crisis, would it be preferable for the government to stabilize the economy using fiscal or monetary policy?
What are the dangers of using fiscal policy?
When might the government have no choice but to use fiscal policy?



Question 15.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding monetary policy?

When interest rates go down, asset prices go up.
The zero lower bound refers to the central banks inability to set the real interest rate to below zero.
Quantitative easing involves the central bank lowering its official interest rate.
Interest rates cannot be set in a currency union.


This is explained in the Unit 10 Einstein.
The central bank can set the real interest rate to below zero by setting the nominal interest rate below the inflation rate (recall the Fisher equation). The problem is that they are unable to set the nominal interest rate below zero, so the real interest rate cannot go below minus the inflation rate.
Quantitative easing involves the central bank buying bonds and other financial assets, shifting the demand curve for these assets to the right. This leads to a rise in the price of the assets and a fall in the interest rates (yields) on those assets.
Members of the currency union lose their ability to set the interest rate nationally. Instead the interest rate is set by the central bank for the common currency area (for example, the ECB for the Eurozone).



Einstein The real interest rate and the Fisher equation
From Unit 10, the interest rate tells you how many dollars (or euros, pounds, or the currency you use) you will have to pay in the future in exchange for borrowing $1 today. If you are a lender, it tells you how many dollars you will receive in the future by giving up the use of $1 today.
The interest rates that you see quoted in bank windows or bank websites are nominal interest rates. That is to say, they do not take inflation into account. If you are a lender, what you really want to know is how many goods you will get in the future in exchange for the goods you dont consume now. If you are a borrower, what matters is how many goods you will have to give up in the future to pay the interest, rather than the total interest measured in dollars. The opportunity cost of the loan is the goods you have to give up, not the money you have to give up. To make this distinction, you need to take account of inflation.
Households and firms make decisions based on real interest rates. Firms will judge which investment projects are worth undertaking using real interest rates, and lenders will charge a higher level of interest on their loans if inflation is expected to erode their lending margins in the future.
The equation for the real interest rate is known as the Fisher equation, named after Irving Fisher, whose physical model of the economy we saw in Unit 2. The Fisher equation states that the real interest rate (per cent per annum) equals the nominal interest rate (per cent per annum) minus the inflation expected over the year ahead:

When evaluating an investment project, the expected inflation rate needs to be taken into account. For a given nominal interest rate, higher inflation reduces the real interest rate, reducing the real cost of borrowing. We can also see that when prices are expected to fall over the year aheadthat is, expected inflation is negative, or deflation is expectedit raises the real interest rate above the nominal interest rate. At the higher real interest rate, some investment projects that would have been undertaken in the absence of forecast deflation are ruled out.
