12.6 Missing markets: Insurance and lemons
We know that a common reason for contracts to be incomplete is that information about an important aspect of the interaction is unavailable, or unverifiable. In particular, information is often asymmetricthat is, one party knows something relevant to the transaction that the other doesnt know.
One form of asymmetric information is a hidden action. In Unit 6 we studied the case of the employee whose choice of how hard to work is hidden from the employer. This causes a problem known as moral hazard. There is a conflict of interest because the employee would prefer not to work as hard as the employer would like, and work effort cannot be specified in the contract. We saw in Unit 9 how the employers response (paying a wage above the reservation level) led to a Pareto-inefficient outcome in the labour market.

Hidden actions and moral hazard
The problem of hidden action occurs when some action taken by one party to an exchange is not known or cannot be verified by the other. For example, the employer cannot know (or cannot verify) how hard the worker she has employed is actually working.
The term moral hazard originated in the insurance industry to express the problem that insurers face, namely, the person with home insurance may take less care to avoid fires or other damages to his home, thereby increasing the risk above what it would be in absence of insurance. This term now refers to any situation in which one party to an interaction is deciding on an action that affects the profits or wellbeing of the other but which the affected party cannot control by means of a contract, often because the affected party does not have adequate information on the action. It is also referred to as the hidden actions problem.
Hidden attributes and adverse selection
The problem of hidden attributes occurs when some attribute of the person engaging in an exchange (or the product or service being provided) is not known to the other parties. An example is that the individual purchasing health insurance knows her own health status, but the insurance company does not.
The term adverse selection refers to the problem faced by parties to an exchange in which the terms offered by one party will cause some exchange partners to drop out. An example is the problem of asymmetric information in insurance: if the price is sufficiently high, the only people who will seek to purchase medical insurance are people who know they are ill (but the insurer does not). This will lead to further price increases to cover costs. Also referred to as the hidden attributes problem (the state of already being ill is the hidden attribute), to distinguish it from the hidden actions problem of moral hazard.

In this section, we introduce a second form of asymmetric information, that of hidden attributes. When you want to purchase a used car, for example, the seller knows the quality of the vehicle. You do not. This attribute of the car is hidden from the prospective buyer. Hidden attributes can cause a problem known as adverse selection.
Hidden attributes and adverse selection
George Akerlof, an economist, was the first to analyse this problem in 1970. Initially his paper on the subject was rejected by two economics journals for being trivial. Another returned it, saying that it was incorrect. Thirty-one years later, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on asymmetric information. Akerlof and co-author Robert Shiller give a simple explanation of the so-called market for lemons in this book: George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller. 2015. Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.
A famous example of how hidden attributes may result in a market failure is known as the market for lemons. A lemon is slang for a used car that you discover to be defective after you buy it. The model describes a used car market:

Every day, 10 owners of 10 used cars consider selling.
The cars differ in quality, which we measure by the true value of the car to its owner. Quality ranges from zero to $9,000 in equal steps: there is one worthless car, one worth $1,000, another worth $2,000, and so on. The average value of the cars is thus $4,500.
There are many prospective buyers and each would happily buy a car for a price equal to its true value, but not more.
Sellers do not expect to receive the full value of their vehicle, but they are willing to sell if they can get more than half the true value. So the total surplus on each carthe gain from trading itwill be half the price of the car.

If prospective buyers were able to observe the quality of every car, then buyers would approach each seller and bargain over the price, and by the end of the day all of the cars (except for the entirely worthless one) would be sold at a price somewhere between their true value and half the true value. The market would have assured that all mutually beneficial trades would take place.
But, on any day, there is a problem: potential buyers have no information about the quality of any car that is for sale. All they know is the true value of the cars sold the previous day. The most that prospective buyers are willing to pay for a car will be the average value of the cars sold the day before.
Now suppose that 10 cars had been offered on the market the day before. We use a proof by contradiction to show that one by one, the sellers of the highest quality cars will drop out of the market, until there is no market for used cars. Consider the market today:

Yesterday all the cars (as we assumed at the start) were put on the market and sold.
The average value of these cars was $4,500, so the most a buyer is willing to pay today will be $4,500.
At the beginning of the day, each prospective seller considers selling his or her car, expecting a price of $4,500 at the most. Most of the owners are happy, because it is more than half the true value of their car.
But one owner isnt pleased. The owner of the best car would not sell unless the price exceeds half the value of his car: more than $4,500.
Prospective buyers will not pay this price. So today the owner of the best car will not offer it for sale. No one with a car worth $9,000 will be willing to participate in this market.
The rest of the cars will sell today: their value averages $4,000.
Tomorrow buyers will know the average value of the cars sold today. And so tomorrow, buyers will decide they will be willing to pay at most $4,000 for a car.
The owner of tomorrows highest-quality car (the one worth $8,000) will know this, and know that she will not get her minimum price, which is greater than $4,000. Tomorrow, she will not offer her car for sale.
As a result, the average quality of cars sold on the market tomorrow will be $3,500, which means the owner of the third-best car will not put his car up for sale the day after tomorrow.
And so it goes on, until, at some point next week, only the owner of a lemon worth $1,000 and a totally worthless car will remain in that days market.
If cars of these two values had sold the previous day, then, the next day, buyers will be willing to pay at most $500 for a car.
Knowing this, the owner of the car worth $1,000 will decide she would rather keep her car.
The only car on the market will be worth nothing. Cars that remain in this market are lemons, because only the owner of a worthless car would be prepared to offer that car for sale.


adverse selectionThe problem faced by parties to an exchange in which the terms offered by one party will cause some exchange partners to drop out. An example is the problem of asymmetric information in insurance: if the price is sufficiently high, the only people who will seek to purchase medical insurance are people who know they are ill (but the insurer does not). This will lead to further price increases to cover costs. Also referred to as the hidden attributes problem (the state of already being ill is the hidden attribute), to distinguish it from the hidden actions problem of moral hazard. See also: incomplete contract, moral hazard, asymmetric information.

Economists call processes like this adverse selection because the prevailing price selects which cars will be left in the market. If any cars are traded, they will be the lower quality ones. The selection of cars is adverse for buyers. In the example above, there are no cars left at allthe market disappears altogether.
Adverse selection in the insurance market

hidden attributes (problem of)This occurs when some attribute of the person engaging in an exchange (or the product or service being provided) is not known to the other parties. An example is that the individual purchasing health insurance knows her own health status, but the insurance company does not. Also known as: adverse selection. See also: hidden actions (problem of).

The market for lemons is a well-known term in economics, but the lemons problemthat is, the problem of hidden attributesis not restricted to the used car market.
Another important example is health insurance. Imagine hypothetically that you will be born into a population in which you do not know whether you will be a person with a serious health problem, or might contract such a problem later in life, or perhaps be entirely healthy until old age. There is a health insurance policy available covering any medical services you may need, and the premium is the same for everyoneit is set according to the average expected medical costs of people in the population, so that for the insurance company the premiums will cover the total expected payout, assuming everyone signs up. Would you buy this health insurance policy?
In this situation, most people would be happy to purchase the policy, because serious illness imposes high costs that are often impossible for an average family to pay. The costs of protecting you and your family from a financial catastrophe (or the possibility that you cant afford healthcare when you need it) are worth the insurance premium.
The assumption that you do not know anything about your health status in this thought experiment is unrealistic. It is another use of John Rawls veil of ignorance that we discussed in Unit 5. Thinking about this problem as an impartial observer highlights the importance of the veil of ignorance assumption.
Though everyone would have bought insurance if they did not know about their future health status, the situation changes dramatically if we can choose whether to buy health insurance without the veil of ignorance, thatis, knowing our health status. In this situation, information is asymmetric. Look at the situation from the standpoint of the insurance company:

People are more likely to purchase insurance if they know that they are ill: So the average health of people buying insurance will be lower than the average health of the population.
This information is asymmetric: The person buying the insurance knows how healthy he or she is, but the insurance company does not.
Insurance companies will be profitable only if they charge higher prices: These prices will be higher than they would charge if all members of the population were forced to purchase the same insurance.
This leads to adverse selection: In which case, the price will be high enough that only people who knew they were ill would wish to purchase insurance.
This leads to even higher prices for insurance: To remain in business, the insurance companies will now have to raise prices again. Eventually the vast majority of the people purchasing insurance will be those who know they already have a serious health problem.
Healthy people are priced out of the market: Those who want to buy insurance in case they fall ill in the future will not buy insurance.

This is another example of a missing market: many people will be uninsured. It is a market that could exist, but only if health information were symmetrical and verifiable (ignoring for the moment the problem of whether everyone would want to share their health data). It could provide benefits to both insurance company owners and people who wanted to insure themselves. Not having such a market is Pareto inefficient.
To address the problem of adverse selection due to asymmetric information, and the resulting missing markets for health insurance, many countries have adopted policies of compulsory enrolment in private insurance programs or universal tax-financed coverage.
Moral hazard in the insurance market

hidden actions (problem of)This occurs when some action taken by one party to an exchange is not known or cannot be verified by the other. For example, the employer cannot know (or cannot verify) how hard the worker she has employed is actually working. Also known as: moral hazard. See also: hidden attributes (problem of).

Hidden attributes are not the only problem facing insurers, whether private or governmental. There is also a problem of hidden actions. Buying an insurance policy may make the buyer more likely to take exactly the risks that are now insured. For example, a person who has purchased full coverage for his car against damage or theft may take less care in driving or locking the car than someone who had not purchased insurance.
Insurers typically place limits on the insurance they sell. For example, coverage may not apply (or may be more expensive) if someone other than the insured is driving, or if the car is usually parked in a place where a lot of cars are stolen. These provisions can be written into an insurance contract.
But the insurer cannot enforce a contract about how fast you drive or whether you drive after having had a drink. These are the actions that are hidden from the insurer because of the asymmetric information: you know these facts, but the insurance company does not.
This is a problem of moral hazard, similar to the one of labour effort. They are both principalagent problems: the agent (an insured person, or employee) chooses an action (how careful to be, or how hard to work) that matters to the principal (the insurance company, or the employer), but cannot be included in the contract because it is not verifiable.

moral hazardThis term originated in the insurance industry to express the problem that insurers face, namely, the person with home insurance may take less care to avoid fires or other damages to his home, thereby increasing the risk above what it would be in absence of insurance. This term now refers to any situation in which one party to an interaction is deciding on an action that affects the profits or wellbeing of the other but which the affected party cannot control by means of a contract, often because the affected party does not have adequate information on the action. It is also referred to as the hidden actions problem. See also: hidden actions (problems of), incomplete contract, too big to fail.principalagent relationshipThis relationship exists when one party (the principal) would like another party (the agent) to act in some way, or have some attribute that is in the interest of the principal, and that cannot be enforced or guaranteed in a binding contract. See also: incomplete contract. Also known as: principalagent problem.

Though seemingly very different, these moral hazard problems are similar in an important respect to chlordecone pollution, and to public goods and common-pool resources in the previous section. In every case, someone makes a decision that has external costs or benefits for someone else: in other words, costs or benefits that are uncompensated. For example in the moral hazard case, the insured person (the agent) decides how much care to take. Taking care has an external benefit for the insurer (principal) but is costly for the agent, so consequently we have a market failure: the level of care chosen is too low.
So these problems of moral hazard (and also the adverse selection problems described earlier in this section) can be placed within the framework of external effects and market failure we are using throughout this unit. The problems arising from asymmetric information are summarized in the table in Figure 12.10.

Exercise 12.8 Hidden attributes
Identify the hidden attributes in the following markets and how they may impede market participants from exploiting all of the possible mutual gains from exchange:

A second-hand good being sold on eBay, Craigslist or a similar online platform
Renting apartments through Airbnb
Restaurants of varying quality

Explain how the following may facilitate mutually beneficial exchanges, even in the presence of hidden attributes:

Electronic ratings shared among past and prospective buyers and sellers
Exchanges among friends, and friends of friends
Trust and social preferences
Intermediate buyers and sellers, such as used car dealers



Question 12.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
There are 10 cars on the market, of which six are good quality cars worth $9,000 to buyers, and the others are lemons, worth zero. There are many potential buyers who do not know the quality of each car, but they know the proportion of good quality cars, and are willing to pay the average value. All sellers are happy to accept a price at least half the value of their car. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The buyers are willing to pay at most $4,500.
Only the lemons will be sold in this market.
All cars will be sold at a price of $5,400.
All cars will be sold at a price of $4,500.


The average value to the buyers is (9,000  6 + 0  4)/10 = $5,400. This is the highest price that the buyers are willing to pay.
There are many buyers willing to pay the average value, which is $5,400. At this price, all sellers are willing to sell; so all cars will be sold.
There are many buyers willing to pay the average value, which is $5,400. At this price, all sellers are willing to sell, so all cars will be sold, and competition between buyers will ensure that the price will be the most they are willing to pay: $5,400.
All sellers will sell if the price is $4,500 or more. There are many buyers willing to pay the average value, which is $5,400. So all cars will be sold, but competition between buyers will drive up the price beyond $4,500.



Question 12.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
In which of the following cases is there an adverse selection problem?

A motor insurance market, in which the insurers do not know how carefully the insured people drive.
A health insurance market, in which the insurers do not know whether or not the applicants for insurance are habitual smokers.
Online sales of nutritional supplements, when consumers cannot tell whether their contents are as claimed by sellers.
A firm that employs home-workers, but cannot observe how hard they are working.


This is a hidden action (moral hazard) problem.
Smoking is a hidden attribute as smokers have higher risks. If the premium was set for people of average risk, non-smokers would be less likely to apply for insurance.
The quality of the product is a hidden attribute. If the price was equal to the marginal cost of average quality products, only the producers of poor quality or fake products would want to sell.
This is a hidden action (moral hazard) problem.
