3.7 Income and substitution effects on hours of work and free time
Imagine that you are looking for a job after you leave college. You expect to be able to earn a wage of $15 per hour. Jobs differ according to the number of hours you have to workso what would be your ideal number of hours? Together, the wage and the hours of work will determine how much free time you will have, and your total earnings.
We will work in terms of daily average free time and consumption, as we did for Angela. We will assume that your spendingthat is, your average consumption of food, accommodation, and other goods and servicescannot exceed your earnings (for example, you cannot borrow to increase your consumption). If we write w for the wage, and you have t hours of free time per day, then you work for (24  t) hours, and your maximum level of consumption, c, is given by:


budget constraintAn equation that represents all combinations of goods and services that one could acquire that exactly exhaust ones budgetary resources.

We will call this your budget constraint, because it shows what you can afford to buy.
In the table in Figure 3.15 we have calculated your free time for hours ofwork varying between 0 and 16 hours per day, and your maximum consumption, when your wage is w = $15.
Figure 3.15 shows the two goods in this problem: hours of free time (t) on the horizontal axis, and consumption (c) on the vertical axis. When we plot the points shown in the table, we get a downward-sloping straight line: this is the graph of the budget constraint. The equation of the budget constraint is:

The slope of the budget constraint corresponds to the wage: for each additional hour of free time, consumption must decrease by $15. The area under the budget constraint is your feasible set. Your problem is quite similar to Angelas problem, except that your feasible frontier is a straight line. Remember that for Angela the slope of the feasible frontier is both the MRT (the rate at which free time could be transformed into grain) and the opportunity cost of an hour of free time (the grain foregone). These vary because Angelas marginal product changes with her hours of work. For you, the marginal rate at which you can transform free time into consumption, and the opportunity cost of free time, is constant and is equal to your wage (in absolute value): it is $15 for your first hour of work, and still $15 for every hour after that.
What would be your ideal job? Your preferred choice of free time and consumption will be the combination on the feasible frontier that is on the highest possible indifference curve. Work through Figure 3.15 to find the optimal choice.

Your ideal job


Your indifference curves show that your ideal job would be at point A, with 18 hours of free time and daily earnings of $90. At this point your MRS is equal to the slope of the budget constraint, which is the wage ($15).




If your indifference curves look like the ones in Figure 3.15, then you would choose point A, with 18 hours of free time. At this point your MRSthe rate at which you are willing to swap consumption for timeis equal to the wage ($15, the opportunity cost of time). You would like to find a job in which you can work for 6 hours per day, and your daily earnings would be $90.
Like the student, you are balancing two trade-offs:






The trade-off
Where it is on the diagram


MRS
Marginal rate of substitution: The amount of consumption you are willing to trade for an hour of free time.
The slope of the indifference curve.


MRT
Marginal rate of transformation: The amount of consumption you can gain from giving up an hour of free time, which is equal to the wage, w.
The slope of the budget constraint (the feasible frontier) which is equal to the wage.




Your two trade-offs.


Figure 3.16 
Your two trade-offs.
        




Your optimal combination of consumption and free time is the point on the budget constraint where:

While considering this decision, you receive an email. A mysterious benefactor would like to give you an income of $50 a dayfor life (all you have to do is provide your banking details.) You realize at once that this will affect your choice of job. The new situation is shown in Figure 3.17: for each level of free time, your total income (earnings plus the mystery gift) is $50 higher than before. So the budget constraint is shifted upwards by $50the feasible set has expanded. Your budget constraint is now:












The effect of additional income on your choice of free time and consumption.


Figure 3.17 
The effect of additional income on your choice of free time and consumption.
        




Notice that the extra income of $50 does not change your opportunity cost of time: each hour of free time still reduces your consumption by $15 (the wage). Your new ideal job is at B, with 19.5 hours of free time. B is the point on IC3 where the MRS is equal to $15. With the indifference curves shown in this diagram, your response to the extra income is not simply to spend $50 more; you increase consumption by less than $50, and you take some extra free time. Someone with different preferences might not choose to increase their free time: Figure 3.18 shows a case in which the MRS at each value of free time is the same on both IC2 and the higher indifference curve IC3. This person chooses to keep their free time the same, and consume $50 more.











The effect of additional income for someone whose MRS doesnt change when consumption rises.


Figure 3.18 
The effect of additional income for someone whose MRS doesnt change when consumption rises.
        





income effectThe effect that the additional income would have if there were no change in the price or opportunity cost.

The effect of additional (unearned) income on the choice of free time is called the income effect. Your income effect, shown in Figure 3.17, is positiveextra income raises your choice of free time. For the person in Figure 3.18, the income effect is zero. We assume that for most goods the income effect will be either positive or zero, but not negative: if your income increased, you would not choose to have less of something that you valued.
You suddenly realize that it might not be wise to give the mysterious stranger your bank account details (perhaps it is a hoax). With regret you return to the original plan, and find a job requiring 6 hours of work per day. A year later, your fortunes improve: your employer offers you a pay rise of $10 per hour and the chance to renegotiate your hours. Now your budget constraint is:

In Figure 3.19a you can see how the budget constraint changes when the wage rises. With 24 hours of free time (and no work), your consumption would be 0 whatever the wage. But for each hour of free time you give up, your consumption can now rise by $25 rather than $15. So your new budget constraint is a steeper straight line through (24, 0), with a slope equal to $25. Your feasible set has expanded. And now you achieve the highest possible utility at point D, with only 17 hours of free time. So you ask your employer if you can work longer hoursa 7-hour day.











Figure 3.19a 
The effect of a wage rise on your choice of free time and consumption.
        




Compare the outcomes in Figure 3.17 and 3.19a. With an increase in unearned income you want to work fewer hours, while the wage increase in Figure 3.19a makes you decide to increase your working hours. Why does this happen? Because there are two effects of a wage increase:

More income for every hour worked: For each level of free time you can have more consumption, and your MRS is higher: you are now more willing to sacrifice consumption for extra free time. This is the income effect we saw in Figure 3.17you respond to additional income by taking more free time as well as increasing consumption.


substitution effectThe effect that is only due to changes in the price or opportunity cost, given the new level of utility.


The budget constraint is steeper: The opportunity cost of free time is now higher. In other words, the marginal rate at which you can transform time into income (the MRT) has increased. And that means you have an incentive to work moreto decrease your free time. This is called the substitution effect.

Leibniz: Mathematics of income and substitution effects
The substitution effect captures the idea that when a good becomes more expensive relative to another good, you choose to substitute some of the other good for it. It is the effect that a change in the opportunity cost would have on its own, for a given utility level.
We can show both of these effects in the diagram. Before the wage rise you are at A on IC2. The higher wage enables you to reach point D on IC4. Figure 3.19b shows how we can decompose the change from A to D into two parts that correspond to these two effects.












The effect of a wage rise on your choice of free time and consumption.


Figure 3.19b 
The effect of a wage rise on your choice of free time and consumption.
        















A rise in wages


When the wage is $15 your best choice of hours and consumption is at point A. The steeper line shows your new budget constraint when the wage rises to $25. Your feasible set has expanded.














Now you can reach a higher indifference curve


Point D on IC4 gives you the highest utility. At point D, your MRS is equal to the new wage, $25. You have only 17 hours of free time, but your consumption has risen to $175.














If there was no change in opportunity cost of free time


The dotted line shows what would happen if you had enough income to reach IC4 without a change in the opportunity cost of free time. You would choose C, with more free time.














The income effect


The shift from A to C is called the income effect of the wage rise; on its own it would cause you to take more free time.














The substitution effect


The rise in the opportunity cost of free time makes the budget constraint steeper. This causes you to choose D rather than C, with less free time. This is called the substitution effect of the wage rise.














The sum of the income and substitution effects


The overall effect of the wage rise depends on the sum of the income and substitution effects. In this case the substitution effect is bigger, so with the higher wage you take less free time.





Income and substitution effects
A wage rise:

raises your income for each level of free time, increasing the level of utility you can achieve
increases the opportunity cost of free time

So it has two effects on your choice of free time:

The income effect (because the budget constraint shifts outwards): the effect that the additional income would have if there were no change in the opportunity cost.
The substitution effect (because the slope of the budget constraint, the MRT, rises): the effect of the change in the opportunity cost, given the new level of utility.


You can see in Figure 3.19b that with indifference curves of this typical shape a substitution effect will always be negative: with a higher opportunity cost of free time you choose a point on the indifference curve with a higher MRS, which is a point with less free time (and more consumption). The overall effect of a wage rise depends on the sum of the income and substitution effects. In Figure 3.19b the negative substitution effect is bigger than the positive income effect, so free time falls.
Technological progress
If you look back at Section 3.6, you will see that Angelas response to a rise in productivity was also determined by these two opposing effects: an increased incentive to work produced by the rise in the opportunity cost of free time, and an increased desire for free time when her income rises.
We used the model of the self-sufficient farmer to see how technological change can affect working hours. Angela can respond directly to the increase in her productivity brought about by the introduction of a new technology. Employees also become more productive as a result of technological change, and if they have sufficient bargaining power, their wages will rise. The model in this section suggests that, if that happens, technological progress will also bring about a change in the amount of time employees wish to spend working.
The income effect of a higher wage makes workers want more free time, while the substitution effect provides an incentive to work longer hours. If the income effect dominates the substitution effect, workers will prefer fewer hours of work.

Question 3.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 3.15 depicts your budget constraint when the hourly wage is $15.
Which of the following is (are) true?

The slope of the budget constraint is the negative of the wage rate (15).
The budget constraint is a feasible frontier with a constant marginal rate of transformation.
An increase in the wage rate would cause a parallel upward shift in the budget constraint.
A gift of $60 would make the budget constraint steeper, with the intercept on the vertical axis increasing to $300.


For every additional hour of free time, you have $15 less to spend on consumption, so the slope of the budget constraint is 15.
The budget constraint is the feasible frontier of the available combinations of free time and consumption. Its slope is constant, so the MRT is constant.
An increase in the wage rate would make the budget constraint steeper, pivoted at the intercept on the horizontal axis, as every hour of free time would now cost more in foregone consumption.
A gift would shift the budget constraint outward in a parallel manner, as the consumer could consume more at any given level of free time.
