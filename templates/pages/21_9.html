21.8 Public funding of basic research, education, and information infrastructure
The pros and cons of various kinds of intellectual property rights are just a part of the problem of designing an effective innovation system. Another important element is the role of the government. Recall, for example, from the introduction of this unit, that in some cases the expected beneficial effects on markets from the spread of mobile phones did not materialize because necessary public infrastructuremostly roads and means of transportwere lacking. Governmental provision of goods and services, such as the roads that would have allowed Indian farmers to benefit from their new access to price information, are essential to successful diffusion of the benefits of innovation. As we shall see, the origins of the computer, and by extension, the entire information revolution makes the essential role of government clear in the innovation process itself.
Adequate public policies concerning innovation can help in two main ways:

Increasing the pace of innovation: This occurs through such interventions as the support of basic research and communications infrastructure, setting standards, as well as the design of patents, copyright, and trademarks.
Influencing the direction of innovation: This tilts the process towards the production of novel ideas and applications with environmental, learning, medical, or other socially valued applications.

Government-funded research
The roots of the IT revolution can be traced to the building of the first electronic programmable computers after the Second World War, although as with any technology, some elements are older. Charles Babbage first proposed a calculating machine called the Difference Engine, in a learned paper published in 1822 (and was funded by the British government to develop it), and his ideas helped Ada Lovelace develop the first computer program.
The British and American governments efforts during and after the Second World War pioneered programmable electronic computing in practice. In the US, the early focus was on supporting the development of missile systems and the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. These projects demanded huge numbers of rapid calculations in ballistics and predicting atomic reactions. US government money supported private entities such as Bell Labs in New Jersey, as well as federal research facilities like Los Alamos.
There was a close partnership between the private sector, government agencies and universities, resulting in the building of the ENIAC machine in 1946 under the auspices of the US Army. It was the first electronic computer, although it could not store programs. Other innovations followed swiftly, such as the development of the transistor by William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1948, as well as the creation of new companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor. American government support for the industry has continued through research funding, including, famously, the creation of the Internet (in 1969) in a project financed by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
In the UK, early progress in computing was focused on the efforts at Bletchley Park, where the mathematician Alan Turing worked, to crack Germanys Enigma code. The Colossus machine developed there remained a secret until the 1970s, but Bletchley Park scientists and engineers went on to build in 1948 the worlds first postwar stored-program computer with a memory, called Baby, at the University of Manchester, another publicly funded institution. The commercial development of computers followed swiftly, by companies such as Ferranti.
This pattern of government funding of early-stage research, either through government agencies including the military or through universities, followed by commercial applications is common. As well as the computer and electronics industries, the Internet, and the World Wide Web (created by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN research laboratory funded by a consortium of governments), the modern pharmaceuticals and biotech sectors, and commercial applications of new materials, such as graphene, all have roots in publicly financed basic research and early-stage development. Touch screens and the computer mouse were also the result of US government-funded research.16
The MP3 format was created by a small group of researchers at a public research lab in Germany, belonging to the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft. Their patent allows shrinking the size of audio files by a factor of 12, while maintaining sound quality. This innovation made music sharing via the Internet possible and contributed to major upheaval in the global music industry. Commercial firms did not initially adopt it as a standard, and it became widely diffused because the creators responded by distributing encoding software to users for a low price and did not pursue hackers who then made it available for free.
Mariana Mazzucato, an economist who specializes in the causes and impacts of innovation, uses the example of some of the basic digital innovations such as the Internet, GPS and touch screens to argue that the government has an essential role in funding research and start-up technology companies. She sees the governments role not just as filling in activities the market will not undertake, perhaps because the returns are too far in the future and uncertain, but also as shaping what kind of activities the private sector will do. In her view, strategic investment by the US government helps explain why American companies dominate high-tech industries including digital and biotechnology.
Competitions and prizes
A quite different policy for the support of innovation is to award a prize for the successful development of a solution to a problem that will meet some specifications. The prize-winner is rewarded for the cost of development, rather than with a monopoly over the novel idea or method, and the innovation then goes immediately into the public domain.
For example, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster, the XPrize Foundation offered $1 million to any team who could significantly improve current technology for the clean-up of oil spills. Within a year, a team had devised a method that quadrupled the industry-standard recovery rate.
A more famous example is the invention by watchmaker John Harrison of the marine chronometer, a device that for the first time allowed the (reasonably) accurate measurement of a vessels longitude at sea. Harrison started work on his chronometer in 1730 in response to an offer made in 1714 by the British government of a cash prize (about 2.5 million in 2014 prices) for the invention of a device to measure longitude. Harrisons approach to the challenge was to build an accurate clock small enough to be seaborne in order that the Greenwich time at which the sun reached its zenith could be determined. This would allow the ships position west of Greenwich to be calculated. The problem had attracted some of the best minds of the time, including Isaac Newtons. Harrison produced many versions, each better than the last, but argued with the government about whether he deserved the prize money. The argument arose because Harrisons solution to the problem was rather different from that expected by the government. He was awarded a series of smaller sums over the years.

Today, the Longitude Prize is funded by the UK government. Unusually the Longitude Committee, which will award the prize, asked the general public to choose from six challenges, which they could direct the prize money towards.
The public selected the problem of resistance to antibiotics, which we noted in Unit 12, a choice that many experts would support. This is interesting because many people are skeptical that government agencies are good at picking where R&D investments should be directed, in spite of the history of rather good investment decisions in technologies during and after the Second World War.
If you believe that the general public are better than governments at identifying pressing problems, then the Longitude Committee have solved this problem neatly by letting us choose.

Another example of where competitions work well is the creation of prizes for the successful development of drugs for neglected diseases. These drugs treat illnesses that are common in parts of the world in which there is little pharmaceutical innovation because the private market for them is limited by the low incomes of those afflicted with the diseases.17






In this video, Mariana Mazzucato suggests that governments should start to take investment stakes in technology companies, so that they will earn a return on the funds they invest in research.



Exercise 21.14 Government-funded research

What are the arguments for and against direct government investment in the commercial application of new technologies?
Describe ways in which governments could pick technologies in which to invest, so that the process would be more transparent to taxpayers.
Do you think it would be sensible to involve taxpayers in the choices about which technologies in which to invest? Explain your answer.
Which kind of technologies do you think governments should spend more on and which technologies should governments leave to the private sector? Explain your answer.



Question 21.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following policies promote efficient innovation processes?

prizes for successful innovation to resolve the coordination problem in the innovation of substitute goods
subsidizing the supply of inputs to innovation, such as public infrastructure, research and education, to alleviate the coordination problem of complementary innovations
establishing a patent system to address high first copy costs of knowledge-intensive innovations
promoting low-cost dissemination of information


Here the problem is the winner-take-all nature of the competitive market of substitute goods (such as Sonys Betamax video tape standard vs JVCs VHS). The public sector agencies should instead promote agreement among the participants in the industry, for example deciding on new technical standards.
In this situation, firms may be reluctant to invest in one innovation unless other firms are investing in the complementary innovation. Subsidizing inputs lowers the costs of innovation and increases the likelihood that firms will invest.
A patent allows the inventor to temporarily profit from his idea, which would make inventors more willing to pay the high up-front costs of innovation.
The public goods nature of the knowledge produced means that the innovating firms cannot capture all of the benefits their innovations generate. A patent system would alleviate this problem.



Question 21.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements are correct regarding public policies for innovation?

The government should not invest in innovations whose returns are too far in the future and uncertain.
By taking equity stakes in innovation companies, the government would enhance its ability to enforce competition policy.
The government could support innovation by setting up a scheme that awards a prize for successful development of a solution to a specific problem.
The government can fund early-stage research, through government agencies such as the military or universities, that can then be used for commercial applications.


These are exactly the kind of innovations that the government should be investing in, instead of relying on firms.
The government may find it more difficult to regulate firms in which it has an equity stake, such as enforcing competition policy or environment standards.
