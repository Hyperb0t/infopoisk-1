2.1 Economists, historians, and the Industrial Revolution
Why did the Industrial Revolution happen first in the eighteenth century, on an island off the coast of Europe?
The following sections of this unit present one model for the sudden and dramatic rise in living standards that began in eighteenth century Britain. Based on arguments from Robert Allen, an economic historian, this model gives a central role to two features of Britains economy at the time. In this account, the relatively high cost of labour, coupled with the low cost of local energy sources, drove the structural changes of the Industrial Revolution.3
What we call the Industrial Revolution was more than just the breaking of the Malthusian cycle: it was a complex combination of inter-related intellectual, technological, social, economic and moral changes. Historians and economists disagree about the relative importance of each of these elements, and have wrestled with explanations for the primacy of Britain, and Europe more generally, ever since their revolutions began. Allens explanation is far from the only one.

Joel Mokyr, who has worked extensively on the history of technology, claims that the real sources of technological change are to be found in Europes scientific revolution and its Enlightenment of the century before. For Mokyr, this period brought the development of new ways to transfer and transform elite scientific knowledge into practical advice and tools for the engineers and skilled artisans, who used it to build the machines of that time. He claims that, while wages and energy prices might tilt the direction of invention in one direction or another, they are more like a steering wheel than the motor of technological progress.4
David Landes, a historian, emphasizes the political and cultural characteristics of nations as a whole (Mokyr, in contrast, focuses on artisans and entrepreneurs). He suggests European countries pulled ahead of China because the Chinese state was too powerful and stifled innovation, and because Chinese culture at the time favoured stability over change.5
Gregory Clark, an economic historian, also attributes Britains take-off to culture. But for Clark, the keys to success were cultural attributes such as hard work and savings, which were passed on to future generations. Clarks argument follows a long tradition that includes the sociologist Max Weber, who saw the Protestant countries of northern Europe, where the Industrial Revolution began, as the particular home of virtues associated with the spirit of capitalism.6
Kenneth Pomeranz, a historian, claims that superior European growth after 1800 was more due to the abundance of coal in Britain than to any cultural or institutional differences with other countries. Pomeranz also argues that Britains access to agricultural production in its New World colonies (especially sugar and its by-products) fed the expanding class of industrial workers, thus helping them to escape the Malthusian trap.7

Scholars will probably never completely agree about what caused the Industrial Revolution. One problem is that this change happened only once, which makes it more difficult for social scientists to explain. Also, the European take-off was probably the result of a combination of scientific, demographic, political, geographic and military factors. Several scholars argue that it was partly due to interactions between Europe and the rest of the world too, not just due to changes within Europe.
Historians like Pomeranz tend to focus on peculiarities of time and place. They are more likely to conclude that the Industrial Revolution happened because of a unique combination of favourable circumstances (they may disagree about which ones).
Economists like Allen are more likely to look for general mechanisms that can explain success or failure across both time and space.
Economists have much to learn from historians, but often a historians argument is not precise enough to be testable using a model (the approach we will use in this unit). On the other hand, historians may regard economists models as simplistic, ignoring important historical facts. This creative tension is what makes economic history so fascinating.
If you want to know what these researchers think of each others work, try searching for Gregory Clark review Joel Mokyr or Robert Allen review Gregory Clark.
Recently, economic historians have made progress in quantifying economic growth over the very long run. Their work helps clarify what happened, which makes it easier for us to think about why it happened. Some of their work involves comparing real wages in countries over the long run. This has involved collecting both wages and the prices of goods that workers consumed. An even more ambitious series of projects has calculated GDP per capita back to the Middle Ages.
We will focus on the economic conditions that contributed to Britains take-off, but each economy that broke out of the Malthusian trap took a different escape route. The national trajectories of the early followers were influenced in part by the dominant role that Britain had come to play in the world economy. Germany, for example, could not compete with Britain in textiles, but the government and large banks played a major role in building steel and other heavy industries. Japan outcompeted even Britain in some Asian textile markets, benefiting from the isolation it enjoyed by the sheer distance from the earlier starters (which in those days was weeks of travel).
Japan selectively copied both technology and institutions, introducing the capitalist economic system while retaining many traditional Japanese institutions including rule by an emperor, which would last until the Japanese defeat in the Second World War.
India and China provide even greater contrasts. China experienced the capitalist revolution when the Communist Party led a transition away from the centrally planned economy, the antithesis of capitalism that the Party itself had implemented. India, by contrast, is the first major economy in history to have adopted democracy, including universal voting rights, prior to its capitalist revolution.
As we saw in Unit 1, the Industrial Revolution did not lead to economic growth everywhere. Because it originated in Britain, and spread only slowly to the rest of the world, it also implied a huge increase in income inequality between countries. Looking at economic growth around the world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, David Landes once asked: Why are we so rich and they so poor?8
By we, he meant the rich societies of Europe and North America. By they he meant the poorer societies of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Landes suggested, a little mischievously, that there were basically two answers to this question:

One says that we are so rich and they so poor because we are so good and they so bad; that is, we are hardworking, knowledgeable, educated, well governed, efficacious, and productive, and they are the reverse. The other says that we are so rich and they so poor because we are so bad and they so good: we are greedy, ruthless, exploitative, aggressive, while they are weak, innocent, virtuous, abused, and vulnerable.

If you think that the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe because of the Protestant Reformation, or the Renaissance, or the scientific revolution, or the development of superior private property rights, or favourable government policies, then you are in the first camp. If you think that it happened because of colonialism, or slavery, or the demands of constant warfare, then you are in the second.
You will notice that these are all non-economic forces that, according to some scholars, had important economic consequences. You can probably also see how the question of which of Landess two answers is right might become ideologically charged although, as Landes points out, It is not clear that one line of argument necessarily precludes the other.
