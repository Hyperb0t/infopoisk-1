Consumption (C)

consumption (C)Expenditure on consumer goods including both short-lived goods and services and long-lived goods, which are called consumer durables.

Consumption includes the goods and services purchased by households. Goods are normally tangible things. Goods like cars, household appliances, and furniture that last for three years or more are called durable goods; those that last for shorter periods are non-durable goods. Services are things that households buy that are normally intangible, such as transportation, housing (payment of rent), gym membership, and medical treatment. Household spending on durable goods like cars and household equipment is counted in consumption in the national accounts, although as we will see, in economic terms the decision to buy these long-lasting items is more like an investment decision.
From the table in Figure 13.7 we see that in the advanced countries, consumption is by far the largest component of GDP, close to 56% in the Eurozone and 68% in the US. This contrasts with China, where final consumption of households accounts for 37% of GDP.
Investment (I)

investment (I)Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (machinery and equipment) and buildings, including new housing.inventoryGoods held by a firm prior to sale or use, including raw materials, and partially-finished or finished goods intended for sale.

This is the spending by firms on new equipment and new commercial buildings; and spending on residential structures (the construction of new housing).
Investment in the unsold output that firms produce is the other part of investment that is recorded as a separate item in the national accounts. It is called the change in inventories or stocks. Including changes in stocks is essential to ensuring that when we measure GDP by the output method (what is produced), it is equal to GDP measured by the expenditure method (what is spent, including investment by firms in unsold inventories).
Investment represents a much lower share of GDP in OECD countries, roughly one-fifth of GDP in the US and the Eurozone. In contrast, investment accounts for almost half of GDP in China.
Government spending on goods and services (G)

government spending (G)Expenditure by the government to purchase goods and services. When used as a component of aggregate demand, this does not include spending on transfers such as pensions and unemployment benefits. See also: government transfersgovernment transfersSpending by the government in the form of payments to households or individuals. Unemployment benefits and pensions are examples. Transfers are not included in government spending (G) in the national accounts. See also: government spending (G)trade balanceValue of exports minus the value of imports. Also known as: net exports. See also: trade deficit, trade surplus.trade deficitA countrys negative trade balance (it imports more than it exports). See also: trade surplus, trade balance.trade surplusA countrys positive trade balance (it exports more than it imports). See also: trade deficit, trade balance.aggregate demandThe total of the components of spending in the economy, added to get GDP: Y = C + I + G + X  M. It is the total amount of demand for (or expenditure on) goods and services produced in the economy. See also: consumption, investment, government spending, exports, imports.

This represents the consumption and investment purchases by the government (consisting of central and local government, often called general government). Government consumption purchases are of goods (such as office equipment, software, and cars) and services (such as wages of civil servants, armed services, police, teachers, and scientists). Government investment spending is on the building of roads, schools, and defence equipment. Much of government spending on goods and services is for health and education.
Government transfers in the form of benefits and pensions, such as Medicare in the US, or social security benefits in Europe, are not included in G because households receive them as income: when they are spent, they are recorded in C or I. It would be double-counting to record this spending in G too.
The share of government spending on goods and services is slightly higher in Europe (21.1%) than in the US (15.1%). Remember, this excludes transfers (such as benefits and pensions). The greater difference in the role of the government between Europe and the US comes from those transfers. In 2012, total government spending including transfers was 57% of GDP in France, compared to 40% of GDP in the US.
Exports (X)
Domestically produced goods and services that are purchased by households, firms, and governments in other countries.
Imports (M)
Goods and services purchased by households, firms, and governments in the home economy that are produced in other countries.
Net exports (X  M)
Also called the trade balance, this is the difference between the values of exports and imports (X  M).
In 2010, the US had a trade deficit of 3.4% of GDP and China had a trade surplus of 3.6% of GDP. The trade balance is a deficit if the value of exports minus the value of imports is negative; it is called a trade surplus if it is positive.
GDP (Y)
To calculate GDP, which is the aggregate demand for what is produced in the country, we add the purchases by those in other countries (exports) and subtract the purchases by home residents of goods and services produced abroad (imports). Taking China as an example, its GDP is the aggregate demand for Chinas output, which includes  its exports less its imports.
Working with national accounts data is a way of learning about the economy, and an easy way to do this is to use the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). To learn more about the country where you live and how it compares to other countries, try Exercise 13.4 for yourself.
In most countries, private consumption spending makes up the largest share of GDP (see Figure 13.7 to check). Investment spending accounts for a much smaller share (Chinas very high level of investment, shown in Figure 13.7, is exceptional). We use the data in the national accounts to calculate how much each component of expenditure contributes towards GDP fluctuations.
The equation below shows how GDP growth can be broken down into the contributions made by each component of expenditure. We can see that the contribution of each component to GDP growth depends on both the share of GDP that the component makes up and its growth over the previous period.

The table in Figure 13.8 shows the contributions of the components of expenditure to US GDP growth. The data is for 2009, in the middle of the recession caused by the global financial crisis. We can see that:

Although investment makes up less than one-fifth of US GDP, it was much more important in accounting for the contraction in the economy than the fall in consumption spending.
Although consumption makes up about 70% of US GDP, the effect of investment on GDP was more than three times larger.
In contrast to consumption and investment, government expenditure contributed positively to GDP growth. The US government used fiscal stimulus to prop up the economy whilst private sector demand was depressed.
Net exports also contributed positively to GDP, which reflects both the stronger performance of emerging economies in the aftermath of the crisis and the collapse in import demand that accompanied the recession.

Shortcomings of GDP as a measure
Three things need to be kept in mind when using the concept of GDP:

It is a conventional measure of the size of an economy: We examined what GDP includes in Unit 1. In Unit 20, the concept of green growth accounting is introduced, which shows how to calculate the size of the economy and its growth taking into account environmental degradation.
Distinguish aggregate GDP from GDP per capita: This is especially important when discussing growth. In this section, the focus has been on GDP and the contributions of the different components of demand to its growth. In other contexts, the relevant concept is a per capita measure. To see the difference, note that GDP in the UK grew by 7% between 2007 and 2015 but GDP per capita grew by only 0.8%. The explanation is that there was a large increase in immigration.
GDP per capita is a flawed measure of living standards: Recall from Unit 1 that Robert Kennedys 1968 speech at the University of Kansas highlighted these flaws (search for Gross National Product in the text).


Exercise 13.4 How to use FRED
If you want real-time macroeconomic data on the German unemployment rate or Chinas output growth, you do not need to learn German and Chinese, or struggle to get to grips with national archives, because FRED does it for you! FRED is a comprehensive up-to-date data source maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis in the US, which is part of the US central banking system. It contains the main macroeconomic statistics for almost all developed countries going back to the 1960s. FRED also allows you to create your own graphs and export data into a spreadsheet.
To learn how to use FRED to find macroeconomic data, follow these steps:

Visit the FRED website.
Use the search bar and type Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the name of a major global economy. Select the annual series for real (constant prices) GDP for this country. This is clearly labelled as Real Gross Domestic Product for your chosen country.
Click the Edit graph button, above the top-right corner of the graph.
Click the Add line button. Search for the annual series for nominal (current prices) GDP. This is labelled as simply Gross Domestic Product for your chosen country. Add this series to your graph.
You can use the Edit graph button to modify the frequency of your data, if it is not annual.

You can also watch this short tutorial to understand how FRED works.
Use the graph you created to answer these questions:

What is the level of nominal GDP in your chosen country this year?
FRED tells you that the real GDP is chained in a specific year (this means that it is evaluated in terms of constant prices for that year). Note that the real GDP and the nominal GDP series cross at one point. Why does this happen?

From the FRED graph, keep only the real GDP series. You can remove a data series by using the graph editing tool. FRED shows recessions in shaded areas for the US economy using the NBER definition, but not for other economies. For other economies, assume that a recession is defined by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. In the graph editing tool, change the units of your series, and select Percentage change from Year Ago. The series now shows the percentage change in real GDP.

How many recessions has your chosen economy undergone over the years plotted in the chart?
What are the two biggest recessions in terms of length and magnitude?

Now add to the graph the quarterly unemployment rate for your chosen economy (click on Add data series under the graph and search for Unemployment and your chosen country name).

How does the unemployment rate react during the two main recessions you have identified?
What was the level of the unemployment rate during the first and the last quarter of negative growth for those two recessions?
What do you conclude about the link between recession and the variation in unemployment?

Note: To make sure you understand how these FRED graphs are created, you may want to extract the data into a spreadsheet, and create a graph showing the growth rate of real GDP and the evolution of the unemployment rate since 1948 for the US economy.


Question 13.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding measuring GDP?

GDP can be measured either as the total spending on domestically produced goods and services, or the total value added in domestic production, or the sum of all incomes received from domestic production.
Information about exports but not imports is necessary to calculate GDP.
Government production is not included in the GDP.
The value added of government production is computed using the price that public goods and services are sold at in the market.


These three different measures of GDP are discussed in Section 13.4.
Foreign demand for domestic production (exports) is a positive contribution to GDP whilst home demand for foreign production (imports) must be subtracted to calculate GDP. Hence information about both is necessary.
Government and public services, for example, primary school education, are included.
Public services, such as primary school education, are not sold in the market. Hence it is assumed that the value added is equal to the amount it costs the government to produce.



Question 13.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following would increase GDP?

A decline in imports, holding all other components of GDP constant.
An increase in remittances paid to domestic residents by relatives living abroad.
An increase in government spending.
A decline in exports.


Imports represent expenditure on foreign goods and services, so a decline in imports implies that a greater share of C, I, and G, which are assumed constant, is being spent on domestic production. Remember that GDP measures spending on domestic production.
This will increase domestic income because domestic residents are richer, but it does not imply an increase in domestic production.
An increase in government spending implies greater expenditure on domestic production.
A decline in exports implies reduced expenditure by foreigners on domestic production so it reduces GDP.
