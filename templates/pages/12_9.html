12.8 The limits of markets
Markets might seem to be everywhere in the economy, but this is not the case. Recall Herbert Simons image from Unit 6 of a Martian viewing the economy. The Martian mainly sees green fields, which are firms. They are connected by red lines representing buying and selling in markets, but many resource allocation decisions are made within the firms. Families, similarly, do not allocate resources among parents and children by buying and selling. Governments use the political process rather than market competition to determine where, and by whom, schools will be built and roads maintained.
Why are some goods and services allocated in markets, while firms, families, and governments allocate others? This is an old question, and there are two basic answers.
First, some kinds of activities are better carried out by families, some by governments, some by firms, and some by markets. It is hard to see, for example, how conceiving and raising children could be effectively carried out by firms or markets. A combination of families and governments (schooling) does the job in most societies.
What determines the balance between firms and markets?
Ronald Coase provided an explanation of the relative importance of firms and markets. Firms exist because for some things, in-house production is more profitable than acquiring the same thing by purchase. The extent of the market is determined by the firms decision about which components of a product to produce and which ones to buy. Coase explained that the boundaries of this divide between the firm and the market are set by the relative costs of the make it and buy it options.
Coases explanation underlines an important fact that is often lost in sometimes heated debates about the merits of decentralized systems of organization-like markets, as opposed to more centralized ones like governments. What he showed is that there are some things that centralized systems (like the firm) are better at, and others that are better handled by the market. And the beauty of this demonstration is that it is not a judgement by some possibly biased observer: it is the verdict of the market itself. Competition among firms ultimately punishes firms that overdo the make it option by overextending the boundaries of the centralized system through internal expansion. And market competition equally punishes the firms that fail to take advantage of centralized decision making by overly opting for the buy it option.
The second answer to the question why some goods are allocated in markets and some in other institutions is quite different from Coases explanation of the boundaries of the firm. People disagree about the appropriate extent of the market, some thinking that some things that are now for sale should be allocated by other means, while others think that markets should take a larger role in the economy.

merit goodsGoods and services that should be available to everyone, independently of their ability to pay.

Those who wish to limit the extent of the market often make two arguments:

Repugnant markets: Marketing some goods and servicesvital organs, or human beingsviolates an ethical norm, or undermines the dignity of those involved.
Merit goods: It is widely held that some goods and services (called merit goods) should be available to people independently of their ability or willingness to pay.

Repugnant markets
In most countries, there are well-established institutions that allow parents to voluntarily give up a baby for adoption. But laws typically prevent parents from selling their infants.
Why do most countries ban the buying and selling of babies? Is it not true that a market for infants would provide parents wishing to sell and would be parents wishing to buy with opportunities for mutual gains from exchange?
Virtually all countries ban the sale of human organs for transplant. Commercial surrogacya woman becoming pregnant and giving birth to a baby for another couple for payis not legal in most countries (although it is legal in some states in the US, Thailand, and Russia). But economic reasoning might hold that it is wrong to prevent these transactions if both parties enter into them voluntarily.
One reason we might object is that the sale may not be truly voluntary, because poverty might force people to enter into a transaction they might later regret. A second reason would be a belief that putting a price on a baby, or a body part, violates a principle of human dignity. It corrupts our attitudes towards others.
Alvin Roth, an economist who won a Nobel Prize for his work, calls these repugnant markets.5
The philosophers Michael Walzer and Michael Sandel have discussed the moral limits of markets. Some market transactions conflict with the way we value humanity, such as buying and selling people as slaves; others with principles of democracy, such as allowing people to sell their votes. We have seen some of the advantages of allocating resources using markets and the price system. In that analysis we implicitly assumed that exchanging the good for money did not affect its intrinsic value to the buyer and seller.67






Michael Sandel investigating the moral limits of his audience in his TED Talk Why we shouldnt trust markets with our civic life.


But parents attitudes to babies and voters appreciation of their democratic rights might both be altered if they were bought and sold. When we consider whether it would be beneficial to introduce a new market, or monetary incentives, we should think about whether this might crowd out other social norms or ethical preferences.
Merit goods
There are some goods and services that are considered special in that they should be made available to all people, even those who lack the ability or willingness to pay for them. These are called merit goods, and they are provided by governments rather than allocated by a market governed by the willingness to pay.
In most countries, primary education is provided free to all children and financed by taxation. Basic health careat least emergency careis also often available to all, irrespective of the ability to pay. The same holds in many countries for legal representation at trial: a person unable to pay for a lawyer should be assigned legal representation without charge. Personal securityprotection from criminal assault or home fires, for exampleis typically ensured in part by publically provided police protection and fire-fighting services.
Why should merit goods be provided to people free of charge? People of limited income do not have access to a great many things. They typically live in sub-standard and often unhealthy housing, and have very limited opportunities for recreational travel. Why are basic health care and schooling, legal representation, and police and fire protection different? The answer is that in many countries, these goods and services are considered the right of every citizen.

Exercise 12.9 Capitalism among consenting adults
Should all voluntary contractual exchanges be allowed among consenting adults?
State what you think about the following (hypothetical) exchanges. You may assume in each case that the people involved are sane, rational adults who have thought about the alternatives and consequences of what they are doing. In each case, decide whether you approve, and if you do not approve, whether you think the transaction should be prohibited. In each case explain why the transaction described produces mutual benefits (that is, it is a Pareto improvement over not allowing the exchange).

A complicated medical procedure has been discovered that cures a rare form of cancer in patients who would otherwise certainly die. Staff shortages make it impossible to treat all those who would benefit, and the hospital has established a policy of first come, first served. Ben, a wealthy patient who is at the bottom of the list, offers to pay Aisha, a poor person on the top of the list, $1 million to exchange places. If Aisha dies (which is very likely), then her children will inherit the money. Aisha agrees.
Melissa is 18. She has been admitted to a good university but does not have any financial aid, and cannot get any. She signs a four-year contract to be a stripper on the Internet and will begin work when she is 19. The company will pay her tuition fees.
You are waiting in line to buy tickets for a movie that is almost sold out. Someone from the back of the line approaches the woman in front of you and offers her $25 to exchange positions in the line (he takes her position in front of you and she takes his at the back of the line).
A politically apathetic person, who never votes, agrees to vote in an election for the candidate who pays him the highest amount.
William and Elizabeth are a wealthy couple who give birth to a baby with a minor birth defect. They sell this baby to their (equally wealthy) neighbours and buy a child without any birth defects from a family who needs the money.
An individual with an adequate income, decides that he would like to sell himself to become the slave of another person. He finds a buyer willing to pay his asking price. The aspiring slave will use the money to further his childrens education.
