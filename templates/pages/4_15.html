4.14 Conclusion
We have used game theory to model social interactions. The invisible hand game illustrates how markets may channel individual self-interest to achieve mutual benefits, but the dominant strategy equilibrium of the prisoners dilemma game shows how individuals acting independently may be faced with a social dilemma.
Evidence suggests that individuals are not solely motivated by self-interest. Altruism, peer punishment, and negotiated agreements all contribute to the resolution of social dilemmas. There may be conflicts of interest over the sharing of the mutual gains from agreement, or because individuals prefer different equilibria, but social preferences and norms such as fairness can facilitate agreement.
