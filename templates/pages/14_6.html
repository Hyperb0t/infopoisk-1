14.5 The multiplier model: Including the government and net exports
Here we add governments and central banks to the model so that we can show how they can stabilize (or destabilize) the economy after a shock. As before, we assume that firms are willing to supply any amount of goods demanded, so:

We saw in Unit 13 that when we include the government and interactions with the rest of the world through exports and imports, aggregate demand can be split into these components:

To understand the aggregate demand function as shown above, it is useful to go through each component in turn:
Consumption
Household consumption spending depends on post-tax income. The government charges a tax t, which we assume is proportional to income. The income left after the payment of tax, (1  t)Y, is called disposable income. The marginal propensity to consume, c1, is the fraction of disposable income (not pre-tax income) consumed. This means that in the aggregate consumption function:

Spending on consumption is written as: C = c0 + c1(1  t)Y.
All of the influences on consumption apart from current disposable income are included in autonomous consumption, c0, and will therefore shift the consumption function in the multiplier diagram. These include wealth and target wealth, collateral effects, and changes in the interest rate.

Investment
We have just seen that investment spending will be influenced by the interest rate and the expected post-tax rate of profit. In the aggregate investment function:

Spending on investment is a function of the interest rate and the expected post-tax rate of profit.
Ceteris paribus, a higher interest rate reduces investment spending, shifting down the aggregate demand curve.
A higher expected post-tax rate of profit raises investment spending, shifting up the aggregate demand curve.

Government spending

exogenousComing from outside the model rather than being produced by the workings of the model itself. See also: endogenous.

Much of government spending (excluding transfers) is on general public services, health, and education. Government spending does not change in a systematic way with changes in income. It is referred to as exogenous.
An increase in government spending shifts the aggregate demand curve up in the multiplier diagram.
Net exports

marginal propensity to importThe change in total imports associated with a change in total income.

The home economy sells goods and services abroad, which are its exports. The amount of foreign goods the home economy demands (its imports) will depend on domestic incomes. The fraction of each additional unit of income that is spent on imports is termed the marginal propensity to import (m), which must be between 0 and 1. So we have:


exchange rateThe number of units of home currency that can be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency. For example, the number of Australian dollars (AUD) needed to buy one US dollar (USD) is defined as number of AUD per USD. An increase in this rate is a depreciation of the AUD and a decrease is an appreciation of the AUD.

If a countrys costs of production fall so that it can sell its goods at a lower price on world markets compared to the prices of other countries, the demand for its exports will increase, and domestic demand for imports will fall. We will see in the next unit that the exchange rate affects the prices of a countrys goods on world markets. Growth in world markets also increases exports. For now, however, we will ignore these effects and assume that exports are also exogenous.
Putting together each of the components of aggregate demand we have:

Both taxes and imports reduce the size of the multiplier. Recall that the multiplier tells us the amount by which an increase in spending (such as a rise in autonomous consumption, investment, government spending, or exports) raises GDP in the economy. When we include taxation and imports in the model, the indirect multiplier effect of a given rise in spending on GDP is smaller. This is because some household income goes straight to the government as taxation, and some is used to buy goods and services produced abroad. Because we assume that the government does not increase its spending when taxes go up, and foreign buyers do not import more of our goods when we import more of theirs, this means that some of an autonomous increase in income does not lead to further indirect increases in income in the domestic economy. Like saving, taxation and imports are referred to as leakages from the circular flow of income. The result is to reduce the indirect effects of an autonomous change in spending on aggregate demand, output, and employment.
To summarize:

A higher marginal propensity to import reduces the size of the multiplier: This makes the aggregate demand curve flatter.
An increase in exports shifts the aggregate demand curve up in the multiplier diagram.
An increase in the tax rate reduces the size of the multiplier: This makes the aggregate demand curve flatter.

The Einstein at the end of this section shows you how to calculate the size of the multiplier in the model once the tax rate and imports are included. To illustrate, we assume a tax rate of 20% (0.2) and a marginal propensity to import of 0.1. Before we introduced the government, we set the marginal propensity to consume, c1, at 0.6. If we use these numbers in the formula for the multiplier that we calculate in the Einstein, we get the result that the value of the multiplier is k = 1.6, compared to 2.5 without including taxation and imports. In the next section we look at how economists have estimated the size of the multiplier from data, why their estimates differ, and why it matters.

Exercise 14.3 The multiplier model
Consider the multiplier model discussed above.

Compare two economies, which differ only in their share of credit-constrained households but are identical otherwise. In which economy is the multiplier larger? Illustrate your answer using a diagram.
On the basis of your comparison of the two economies, would you expect the multiplier in an economy to vary over its business cycle?
Some economists estimated the size of the multiplier in the Great Depression to be equal to 1.8. Explain how the following characteristics of the US economy at the time could have affected its value:
      
the size of government (see Figure 14.1)
the fact that there were no unemployment benefits
the fact that the share of imports was small





Question 14.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
The aggregate demand of an open economy is given by the after-tax domestic consumption C, the investment I (which depends on the interest rate r), the government spending G and net exports X  M:

c0 is autonomous consumption, c1 is the marginal propensity to consume, and m is the marginal propensity to import. In the economys equilibrium this equals its output: AD = Y. Solving for Y yields:

Given this equation, which of the following increases the multiplier?

A fall in government spending.
A fall in the interest rate.
A fall in the marginal propensity to import.
A rise in the tax rate.


G affects the level of AD but not the multiplier.
r affects I(r), which in turn affects the level of AD but not the multiplier.
A fall in m increases the multiplier. This is because it reduces leakages in the economy.
A rise in t reduces the multiplier.



Einstein The multiplier in an economy with a government and foreign trade
We can again use the fact that there is equilibrium in the goods market when output is equal to aggregate demand to find the multiplier (equilibrium is where the aggregate demand line crosses the 45-degree line in the multiplier diagram). The aggregate demand equation can be rearranged to solve for output and consequently the multiplier:

Therefore:

We can see that the multiplier is smaller when we introduce the government and foreign trade:

The reason is that the denominator on the left-hand side is larger than on the right:
