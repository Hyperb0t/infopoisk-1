8.5 Competitive equilibrium: Gains from trade, allocation, and distribution
Buyers and sellers of bread voluntarily engage in trade because both benefit. Their mutual benefits from the equilibrium allocation can be measured by the consumer and producer surpluses introduced in Unit 7. Any buyer whose willingness to pay for a good is higher than the market price receives a surplus: the difference between the WTP and the price paid. Similarly, if the marginal cost of producing a good is below the market price, the producer receives a surplus. Figure 8.9a shows how to calculate the total surplus (the gains from trade) at the competitive equilibrium in the market for bread, in the same way as we did for the markets in Unit 7.

The consumer surplus


At the equilibrium price of 2 in the bread market, a consumer who is willing to pay 3.50 obtains a surplus of 1.50.














Total consumer surplus


The shaded area above 2 shows total consumer surplusthe sum of all the buyers gains from trade.














The producer surplus


Remember from Unit 7 that the producers surplus on a unit of output is the difference between the price at which it is sold, and the marginal cost of producing it. The marginal cost of the 2,000th loaf is 1.25; since it is sold for 2, the producer obtains a surplus of 0.75.














Total producer surplus


The shaded area below 2 is the sum of the bakeries surpluses on every loaf that they produce. The whole shaded area shows the sum of all gains from trade in this market, known as the total surplus.




When the market for bread is in equilibrium with the quantity of loaves supplied equal to the quantity demanded, the total surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the supply curve.
Notice how the equilibrium allocation in this market differs from the allocation of a differentiated product, Beautiful Cars, in Unit 7. The equilibrium quantity of bread is at the point where the market supply curve, which is also the marginal cost curve, crosses the demand curve, and the total surplus is the whole of the area between the two curves. Figure 7.13 showed that in the market for Beautiful Cars, the manufacturer chooses to produce a quantity below the point where the marginal cost curve meets the demand curve, and the total surplus is lower than it would be at that point.

deadweight lossA loss of total surplus relative to a Pareto-efficient allocation.

The competitive equilibrium allocation of bread has the property that the total surplus is maximized. Figure 8.9b shows that the surplus would be smaller if fewer than 5,000 loaves were produced. There would be consumers without bread who would be willing to pay more than the cost of producing another loaf, so there would be unexploited gains from trade. The total gains from trade in the market would be lower. We say there would be a deadweight loss equal to the triangle-shaped area. Producers would be missing out on potential profits, and some consumers would be unable to obtain the bread they were willing to pay for.

And if more than 5,000 loaves were produced, the surplus on the extra loaves would be negative: they would cost more to make than consumers were willing to pay.

Joel Waldfogel, an economist, gave his chosen discipline a bad name by suggesting that gift-giving at Christmas may result in a deadweight loss.3 If you receive a gift that is worth less to you than it cost the giver, you could argue that the surplus from the transaction is negative. Do you agree?4

At the equilibrium, all the potential gains from trade are exploited, which means there is no deadweight loss. This propertythat the combined consumer and producer surplus is maximized at the point where supply equals demandholds in general: if both buyers and sellers are price-takers, the equilibrium allocation maximizes the sum of the gains achieved by trading in the market, relative to the original allocation. We demonstrate this result in our Einstein at the end of this section.
Pareto efficiency

Pareto efficientAn allocation with the property that there is no alternative technically feasible allocation in which at least one person would be better off, and nobody worse off.

At the competitive equilibrium allocation in the bread market, it is not possible to make any of the consumers or firms better off (that is, to increase the surplus of any individual) without making at least one of them worse off. Provided that what happens in this market does not affect anyone other than the participating buyers and sellers, we can say that the equilibrium allocation is Pareto efficient.
Pareto efficiency follows from three assumptions we have made about the bread market.
Price-taking
The participants are price-takers. They have no market power. When a particular buyer trades with a particular seller, each of them knows that the other can find an alternative trading partner willing to trade at the market price. Sellers cant raise the price because of competition from other sellers, and competition from other buyers prevents buyers from lowering it. Hence the suppliers will choose their output so that the marginal cost (the cost of the last unit produced) is equal to the market price.
In contrast, the producer of a differentiated good has bargaining power because it faces less competition: no one else produces an identical good. The firm uses its power to keep the price high, raising its own share of the surplus but lowering total surplus. The price is above marginal cost, so the allocation is Pareto inefficient.
A complete contract
The exchange of a loaf of bread for money is governed by a complete contract between buyer and seller. If you find there is no loaf of bread in the bag marked bread when you get home, you can get your money back. Compare this with the incomplete employment contract in Unit 6, in which the firm can buy the workers time, but cannot be sure how much effort the worker will put in. We will see in Unit 9 that this leads to a Pareto-inefficient allocation in the labour market.
No effects on others
We have implicitly assumed that what happens in this market affects no one except the buyers and sellers. To assess Pareto efficiency, we need to consider everyone affected by the allocation. If, for example, the early morning activities of bakeries disrupt the sleep of local residents, then there are additional costs of bread production and we ought to take the costs to the bakeries neighbours into account too. Then, we may conclude that the equilibrium allocation is not Pareto efficient after all. We will investigate this type of problem in Unit 12.
Fairness
Remember from Unit 5 that there are two criteria for assessing an allocation: efficiency and fairness. Even if we think that the market allocation is Pareto efficient, we should not conclude that it is necessarily a desirable one. What can we say about fairness in the case of the bread market? We could examine the distribution of the gains from trade between producers and consumers: Figure 8.9a showed that both consumers and firms obtain a surplus, and in this example consumer surplus is slightly higher than producer surplus. You can see that this happens because the demand curve is relatively steep compared with the supply curve. Recall also from Unit 7 that a steep demand curve corresponds to a low elasticity of demand. Similarly, the slope of the supply curve corresponds to the elasticity of supply: in Figure 8.9a, demand is less elastic than supply.
In general, the distribution of the total surplus between consumers and producers depends on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.
We might also want to take into account the market participants standard of living. For example, if a poor student buys a book from a rich student, we might think that an outcome in which the buyer paid less than the market price (closer to the sellers reservation price) would be better, because it would be fairer. Or, if the consumers in the bread market were exceptionally poor, we might decide that it would be better to pass a law setting a maximum bread price lower than 2.00 to achieve a fairer (although Pareto-inefficient) outcome.5 In Unit 11, we will look at the effect of regulating markets in this way.
The Pareto efficiency of a competitive equilibrium allocation is often interpreted as a powerful argument in favour of markets as a means of allocating resources. But we need to be careful not to exaggerate the value of this result:

The allocation may not be Pareto efficient: We might not have taken everything into account.
There are other important considerations: Fairness, for example.
Price-takers are hard to find in real life: It is not as easy as you might think to find behaviour consistent with our simple model of the bread market (as we will see in Section 8.9).


willingness to pay (WTP)An indicator of how much a person values a good, measured by the maximum amount he or she would pay to acquire a unit of the good. See also: willingness to accept.willingness to accept (WTA)The reservation price of a potential seller, who will be willing to sell a unit only for a price at least this high. See also: willingness to pay.


Exercise 8.3 Maximizing the surplus
Consider a market for the tickets to a football match. Six supporters of the Blue team would like to buy tickets; their valuations of a ticket (their WTP) are 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3. The diagram below shows the demand curve. Six supporters of the Red team already have tickets, for which their reservation prices (WTA) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.













Draw the supply and demand curves on a single diagram (Hint: the supply curve is also a step function, like the demand curve).

Suppose all trades are to take place at a single price as in a competitive market where buyers and sellers are price takers.

Show that four trades take place in equilibrium.
What is the equilibrium price?
Calculate the consumer (buyer) surplus by adding up the surpluses of the four buyers who trade.
Similarly calculate the producer (or seller) surplus.
Hence, find the total surplus in equilibrium.


Now suppose that the market operates through bargaining between individual buyers and sellers. Find a way of matching the buyers and sellers so that more than four trades occur. (Hint: suppose the highest WTP buyer buys from the highest WTA seller.)
In this case, work out the surplus from each trade.
How does the total surplus in this case compare with the equilibrium surplus?
Starting from the allocation of tickets you obtained through bargaining, in which at least five tickets are owned by Blue supporters, is there a way through further trade to make one of the supporters better off without making anyone worse off?



Exercise 8.4 Surplus and deadweight loss

Sketch a diagram to illustrate the competitive market for bread, showing the equilibrium where 5,000 loaves are sold at a price of 2.00.
Suppose that the bakeries get together to form a cartel. They agree to raise the price to 2.70, and jointly cut production to supply the number of loaves that consumers demand at that price. Shade the areas on your diagram to show the consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss caused by the cartel.
For what kinds of goods would you expect the supply curve to be highly elastic?
Draw diagrams to illustrate how the share of the gains from trade obtained by producers depends on the elasticity of the supply curve.



Question 8.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Figure 8.9a, the market equilibrium output and price of the bread market is shown to be at (Q*, P*) = (5,000, 2). Suppose that the mayor decrees that bakeries must sell as much bread as consumers want, at a price of 1.50. Which of the following statements are correct?

The consumer and producer surpluses both increase.
The producer surplus increases but the consumer surplus decreases.
The consumer surplus increases but the producer surplus decreases.
The total surplus is lower than at the market equilibrium.


Producer surplus is lower, because the price is below marginal cost.
Consumer surplus is higher, because the price of the first 5,000 loaves is lower, and for the additional loaves it is below the consumers WTP.
The consumers benefit from the lower price, but producers lose because the price is below marginal cost.
There is a deadweight loss, equal to the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves to the right of equilibrium.



Question 8.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements about a competitive equilibrium allocation are correct?

It is the best possible allocation.
No buyers or sellers surplus can be increased without reducing someone elses surplus.
The allocation must be Pareto efficient.
The total surplus from trade is maximized.


The allocation maximizes the total surplus, but the does not mean it is best for everyone in the marketfor example, we may think it is unfair.
This must be true, since the allocation maximizes the total surplus.
The equilibrium allocation may not be Pareto efficient if it affects someone other than the buyers or sellers.
This is a general property of competitive equilibrium.



Einstein Total surplus and WTP
However the market works, and whatever prices are paid, we can calculate the consumer surplus by adding together the differences between WTP and price paid for all the people who buy, and the producer surplus by adding together the difference between price received and marginal cost of every unit of output:


Then when we calculate the total surplus, the prices paid and received cancel out:

When buyers and sellers are price-takers, and the price equalizes supply and demand, the total surplus is as high as possible, because the consumers with the highest WTPs buy the product and the units of output with the lowest marginal costs are sold. Every trade involves a buyer with a higher WTP than the sellers reservation value, so the surplus would go down if we omitted any of them. And if we tried to include any more units of output in this calculation, the surplus would also go down because the WTPs would be lower than the MCs.
