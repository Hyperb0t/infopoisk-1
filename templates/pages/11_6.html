11.5 The value of an asset: Basics

assetAnything of value that is owned. See also: balance sheet, liability.

People buy fish, hats, and fuel for their consumption value: to eat, wear, or burn them (respectively). Markets for assets can work differently because buyers have a second motive: not only to benefit in some way while owning the asset, but also to be able to sell it later. So what determines the value of an asset, whether it is real estate, an artwork, or a financial asset, such as shares in a firm?
Remember from Unit 6 that the profits of a firm belong to its shareholders in direct proportion to the shares that each holds. These profits are typically divided between dividends paid directly to shareholders, and retained earnings used to maintain and expand the firms ability to generate revenues. But since the future is so uncertain, how should these shares be valued?
Two important determinants of the value of a financial asset (also called a security) are the size of the cash flows that it is expected to generate, and uncertainty in ones forecasts of these cash flows.
Bonds

government bondA financial instrument issued by governments that promises to pay flows of money at specific intervals.

It is easiest to start with an asset that promises a fixed stream of payments at specified dates over a finite period. Suppose investors are completely confident that the promised payments will be made. The best example of this is a government bond issued by a country with a negligible likelihood of default, such as the US or Switzerland (this case was analysed in the Einstein in Unit 10).

bondA type of financial asset for which the issuer promises to pay a given amount over time to the holder. Also known as: corporate bonds.

Investors will be willing to buy and hold the asset only if its rate of returnthe future payments relative to the price at which it can be bought or soldcompares well with interest rates on similar assets elsewhere in the economy. The promised stream of payments is fixed, so the lower the price of the asset, the greater will be the interest rate that it yields to a buyer. In other words, the price of the asset will be inversely related to the interest rate that the asset yields. If other interest rates in the economy rise, the interest rate on bonds will have to rise tooso the price of bonds will fall.
Now consider corporate bonds, which are not risk-free. The greater the risk of default, the higher will be the interest rate that investors demand in order to hold the asset. If two bonds promise exactly the same stream of payments, the riskier one will have a lower price. Investors will earn a higher interest rate if they buy the riskier bond and it happens not to default, but face a greater risk that the promised payments will not all materialize.
Stocks

shareA part of the assets of a firm that may be traded. It gives the holder a right to receive a proportion of a firms profit and to benefit when the firms assets become more valuable. Also known as: common stock.

Stocks (also called shares) differ from bonds in two important respects: there is no specific promised stream of payments, and the time period over which payments will be made is not fixed. Firms expected to generate greater net earnings will have higher valuations, and if expectations change, so will the value of the shares. But like bonds, their value will also depend on interest rates elsewhere in the economy, and on how risky the earnings are thought to be.
Risk

systematic riskA risk that affects all assetsin the market, so that it is not possible for investors to reduce their exposure to the risk by holding a combination ofdifferentassets. Also known as: undiversifiable risk.idiosyncratic riskA risk that only affects a small number of assets at one time. Traders can almost eliminate their exposure to such risks by holding a diverse portfolio of assetsaffected bydifferent risks. Also known as: diversifiable risk.

But how should the risk of an asset be assessed? Answering this question requires us to understand the distinction between systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk. The earnings of a firm may rise above or fall short of expectations for various reasons. Some eventssuch as changes in trade policy, interest rates, or economy-wide demand for goods and services simultaneously affect broad classes of financial assets. Other eventssuch as a successful drug trial, or lawsuit alleging safety problems for a vehicleaffect only the specific firms that stand to lose or gain. The first source of risk is called systematic or undiversifiable, the second idiosyncratic or diversifiable.

systemic riskA risk that threatens the financial system itself.

A third type of risk, systemic risk, usually refers to risks that threaten the financial system itself. We will examine examples of systemic risk, such as the 2008 financial crisis, in Unit 17.

This insight was developed by William Sharpe, John Lintner, and others in the 1960s, building on prior work by Harry Markowitz.

An important insight in the economics of finance is that diversifiable risk is essentially irrelevant in the valuation of securities, because investors can almost eliminate it by constructing portfolios that contain a large number of assets, each of which has a very small weight. In any given period some of the firms in the portfolio will experience positive shocks, and some negative, but as long as shocks are truly idiosyncratic, they will tend to cancel each other out and the portfolio itself will be largely unaffected.
Systematic risk is different. It arises from shocks that affect large classes of securities simultaneously and cannot be diversified away. Different firms are exposed to different levels of systematic risk, depending on the degree to which their earnings are correlated with those of the market as a whole. For example, the earnings of Ford or Chrysler are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the economy as a whole, since people postpone purchases of cars during economic downturns. In contrast, utility companies providing gas and electricity to residential customers are sheltered from such risks since energy consumption is not very sensitive to economic conditions.

market capitalization rateThe rate of return that is just high enough to induce investors to hold shares in a particular company. This will be high if the company is subject to ahighlevel of systematic risk.

Investors will demand higher average returns from shares in companies with high levels of systematic risk, since their earnings will tend to be volatile in ways that cannot be easily diversified away. The rate of return that will induce investors to buy shares in a company is sometimes called the required rate of return, or the market capitalization rate. Ceteris paribus, this rate will be higher for companies subject to greater systematic risk. So for any given beliefs about expected future earnings, share values will be higher for companies with lower market capitalization rates.
Trading strategies

fundamental value of a shareThe share price based on anticipated future earnings and the level of risk.

The share price computed from such considerationsanticipated future earnings and the level of systematic riskis sometimes called the fundamental value of a share or security. Many institutional investors, including actively managed mutual funds and some hedge funds, adopt trading strategies based on buying assets that they perceive to be priced below their fundamental values, and selling those that are overpriced relative to fundamentals.
However, there are other trading strategies that are not based on an assessment of fundamental value at all. For instance, some traders look for evidence of momentum in asset prices, buying because they expect prices to rise further, or selling because they expect prices to fall. An investor might be willing to pay more than the fundamental value of a security if she believes that the price will rise even further above this value. In this case, the buyer could make a gain by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price, even if the fundamental value of the security had not changed.

speculationBuying and selling assets in order to profit from an anticipated change in their price.

Buying and selling assets based on an assessment of their fundamental values is a form of speculation, motivated by a belief that prices will soon return to their fundamental values. Buying and selling based on perceived momentum is also an example of speculation, motivated by a belief that short-run trends have a degree of persistence. These strategies, and many others, are present in modern financial markets. They determine the behaviour of prices, and the possibility of bubbles and crashes (as we shall see in later sections).

How economists learn from facts The wisdom of crowds: The weight of stock (oxen) and the value of stocks
What is the right price for, say, a share in Facebook? Would it be better for the price to be set by economic experts, rather than determined in the market by the actions of millions of people, few of whom have expert knowledge about the economy or the companys prospects?
Economists are far from understanding the details of how this mechanism actually works. But an important insight comes from an unusual source: a guessing game played in 1907 at an agricultural fair in Plymouth, England. Attendees at the fair were presented with a live ox. For sixpence (2.5p), they could guess the oxs dressed weight, meaning how much saleable beef could be obtained. The entrant whose answer written on a ticket came closest to the answer would win the prize.
The polymath Francis Galton later obtained the tickets associated with that contest. He found that a player chosen at random missed the correct weight by an average of 40 lbs. But what he called the vox populi or voice of the peoplethe median value of all the guesseswas remarkably close to the true value, deviating by only 9 lbs (less than 1%).
The insight that is relevant to economics is that the average of a large number of not-very-well-informed people is often extremely accurate. It is possibly more accurate than the estimate of an experienced veterinarian or ox breeder.
Galtons use of the median to aggregate the guesses meant that vox populi was the voice of the (assumed) most informed player but it was the guesses of all the others that picked out this most informed player. Voxpopuli was obtained by taking all of the information available, including the hunches and fancies that drove outliers high or low.
Galtons result is an example of the Wisdom of the Crowd. This concept is particularly interesting for economists because it contains, in a stylized format, many of the ingredients that go into a good price mechanism.
As Galton himself noted, the guessing game had a number of features contributing to the success of vox populi. The entry fee was small, but not zero, allowing many to participate, but deterring practical jokers. Guesses were written and entered privately, and judgements were uninfluenced by oratory and passion. The promise of a reward focused the attention.
Although many participants were well informed, many were less so and, as Galton noted, were guided by others at the fair and their imagination. Galtons choice of the median value would reduce (but not eliminate) the influence of these less-informed guessers, preventing individual wild guesses (say, those 10 times the true value) from pulling the vox populi away from the views of the group as a whole.
The stock market represents another expression of vox populi, where people guess at the value of a company, often but not always quite accurately tracking changes in the quality of management, technology, or market opportunities.
The wisdom of crowds also explains the success of prediction markets. The Iowa Electronic Markets, run by the University of Iowa, allows individuals to buy and sell contracts that pay off depending on who wins an upcoming election. The prices of these assets pool the information, hunches, and guesses of large numbers of participants. Such prediction marketsoften called political stock marketscan provide uncannily accurate forecasts of election results months in advance, sometimes better than polls and even poll-aggregation sites. Other prediction markets allow thousands of people to bet on such events as who will win the Oscar for best female lead. It was even proposed to create a prediction market for the next occurrence of a major terrorist attack in the US.


Question 11.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

The fundamental value of the shares in a firm is determined by expected future profits and systematic risk.
If there is no new information regarding the future profitability or systematic risk of a firm, but its share price keeps rising, the fundamental value must be increasing.
Buying a share at a price above its fundamental value in the hope that someone else would buy it from you at an even higher price is guaranteed to lose money.
All investors always agree on the fundamental value of the shares in a firm.


Expected future profits and systematic risk determine the stream of income an investor can expect. This is what we mean by the fundamental value.
With no new information about profitability or risk, the fundamental value has not changed, so a rising price indicates speculation.
It is possible to benefit from this strategy if you sell before the price falls.
Investors do not necessarily agree, since they may have different information about future profitability.
