5.9 Politics: Sharing the surplus
Bruno thinks that the new rules, under which he makes an offer that Angela will not refuse, are not so bad after all. Angela is also better off than she had been when she had barely enough to survive. But she would like a share in the surplus.
She and her fellow farm workers lobby for a new law that limits working time to 4 hours a day, while requiring that total pay is at least 4.5 bushels. They threaten not to work at all unless the law is passed.

Bruno
Angela, you and your colleagues are bluffing.
Angela
No, we are not: we would be no worse off at our reservation option than under your contract, working the hours and receiving the small fraction of the harvest that you impose!

Angela and her fellow workers win, and the new law limits the working day to 4 hours.
How did things work out?
Before the short-hours law Angela worked for 8 hours and received 4.5bushels of grain. This is point D in Figure 5.9. The new law implements the allocation in which Angela and her friends work 4 hours, getting 20 hours of free time and the same number of bushels. Since they have the same amount of grain and more free time, they are better off. Figure 5.9 shows they are now on a higher indifference curve.

Before the short hours law


Bruno makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer, gets grain equal to CD, and Angela works 8 hours. Angela is on her reservation indifference curve at D and MRS = MRT.














What Angela receives before legislation


Angela gets 4.5 bushels of grain: she is just indifferent between working for 8hours and her reservation option.














The effect of legislation


With legislation that reduces work to 4hours and keeps Angelas amount of grain unchanged, she is on a higher indifference curve at F. Brunos grain is reduced from CD to EF (2 bushels).














MRT > MRS


When Angela works 4 hours, the MRT is larger than the MRS on the new indifference curve.




The new law has increased Angelas bargaining power and Bruno is worse off than before. You can see she is better off at F than at D. She is also better off than she would be with her reservation option, which means she is now receiving an economic rent.
Angelas rent can be measured, in bushels of grain, as the vertical distance between her reservation indifference curve (IC1 in Figure 5.9) and the indifference curve she is able to achieve under the new legislation (IC2). We can think of the economic rent as:

The maximum amount of grain per year that Angela would give up to live under the new law rather than in the situation before the law was passed.
Or (because Angela is obviously political) the amount she would be willing to pay so that the law passed, for example by lobbying the legislature or contributing to election campaigns.


Question 5.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Figure 5.9, D and F are the outcomes before and after the introduction of a new law that limits Angelas work time to four hours a day while requiring a minimum pay of 4.5 bushels. Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?

The change from D to F is a Pareto improvement.
The new outcome F is Pareto efficient.
Both Angela and Bruno receive economic rents at F.
As a result of the new law, Bruno has less bargaining power.


It is not a Pareto improvement, because Bruno is worse off (gets less grain) at F than at D.
At outcome F, where Angela works for 4 hours, MRT > MRS (compare the slopes of the feasible frontier and indifference curve). So it cannot be Pareto efficient. (For example, Bruno could be better off, without making Angela worse off, if they could move to the left along IC2.)
At F, Angela is above her reservation indifference curve and is thus receiving an economic rent. Brunos reservation option is to receive nothing, so the grain he receives at F is an economic rent for him.
At D, Bruno obtained rent equal to CD, and Angela obtained no rent. At F his rent is much lower. The law has increased Angelas bargaining power and reduced Brunos.
