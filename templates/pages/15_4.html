15.3 Inflation, the business cycle, and the Phillips curve
When central banks report their interest rate decision to the public, they normally justify a rise in the interest rate by saying that forecast inflation is up. They are raising the interest rate to dampen aggregate demand, raise cyclical unemployment, and as a result, bring inflation back toward target.
Conversely, if they are announcing a lower interest rate, they explain that this is because there is a danger of inflation falling too low (possibly into deflation). Just as a reduction in aggregate demand and employment will bring inflation down, a rise in aggregate demand and employment will increase inflation.
To model inflation, we assume that the HR departments of firms set nominal wages (for example, in dollars, pounds, or euros) once a year, and that the marketing departments set prices immediately after wages. The real wage that employees care about is their nominal wage relative to the economy-wide level of prices, and is defined as:


real wageThe nominal wage, adjusted to take account of changes in prices between different time periods. It measures the amount of goods and services the worker can buy. See also: nominal wage.

It is the real wage on the vertical axis in the labour market diagram in Question 15.4.
To see how inflation comes about in a business cycle upswing, we begin with the economy at the labour market equilibrium and with constant prices, and consider a rise in aggregate demand, which reduces unemployment below the equilibrium.

When unemployment is low, the HR department needs to set higher wages: The cost of job loss is low and workers expect higher real wages if they are to work effectively.
Higher wages mean higher costs for firms: The marketing department will raise prices to cover the higher costs. As long as competitive conditions have not changed, the firms markup will be unchanged.
The price level will have gone up: Once all firms in the economy have set higher prices, the economy has experienced wage and price inflation. And real wages have not increased: the percentage increase in W equals the percentage increase in P, so W/P is unchanged.


wage-price spiralThis occurs if an initial increase in wages in the economy is followed by an increase in the price level, which is followed by an increase in wages and so on. It can also begin with an initial increase in the price level.

What happens next? We assume that aggregate demand remains high enough to keep unemployment below the labour market equilibrium. At the next annual round of wage-setting, the HR department is in the same position as the previous year: with continuing low unemployment, workers are disappointed with their real wage. It must raise nominal wages. When costs go up, the marketing department raises prices once more. This is called the wage-price spiral. It explains why, at low unemployment, the price level rises, not just in the year that unemployment fell, but year after year.
If there is a recession instead of a boom, the wage-price spiral operates in reverse, and the price level falls year after year.
We now ask why prices would have been constant year after year before the boom in aggregate demand reduced unemployment. We will see that when the labour market is in equilibrium (the normal phase of the business cycle), there is no pressure for wages and prices to change. From Unit 9 we know that labour market equilibrium is where the wage-setting curve and the price-setting curve intersect. But why is this unemployment rate so special for the rate of inflation?
In Figure 15.4a, it is only at point (A), where the real wage on the wage-setting curve coincides with the real wage on the price-setting curve, that the labour market is at a Nash equilibrium. As we saw in Unit 9, at this point both workers and firms are doing the best that they can, given the actions of the other. At A, the claims of owners for profits and of workers for wages add up exactly to the size of the pie (the sum of the double-headed arrows showing the profits per worker and real wages is equal to output per worker, which is shown by the red dashed line). This means that the HR department will have no reason to raise wages, and with no increase in costs, the marketing department will keep prices unchanged. The real wage will remain constant and no one will be disappointed.











Figure 15.4a 
Inflation and conflict over the pie: Stable price level at labour market equilibrium.
        




In an economy at the unemployment rate at labour market equilibrium (point A), wages and prices will be stable and inflation will be zero.
We now use the labour market diagram to show what happens in a boom, when unemployment is lower than at A. Figure 15.4b shows how workers claims to real wages and firms claims to real profits sum to more than total productivity when unemployment is below equilibrium, and sum to less than total productivity when unemployment is above equilibrium. When unemployment is below equilibrium this leads to upwards pressure on wages and prices, or a rising wage-price spiral. When unemployment is above equilibrium it leads to downwards pressure on wages and prices, or a declining wage-price spiral.
If we sketch the relationship between inflation and unemployment from the three phases of the business cycle, we get something similar to the one Phillips discovered in the data: when unemployment is lower, inflation is higher and vice versa.












Figure 15.4b 
Inflation and conflict over the pie at low and high unemployment.
        















Labour market equilibrium at A


At A, the economy is at labour market equilibrium. The real wage on the wage-setting curve is equal to that on the price-setting curve, so firms claims to real profit per worker plus the workers claims to real wages sum to labour productivity.














Low unemployment at B


At low unemployment, the real wage required so that workers will work hard increases so the claims of workers for wages and owners for profits are inconsistent: they sum to more than labour productivity.














High unemployment at C


At high unemployment, workers are in a weaker bargaining position. The claims of workers and owners sum to less than labour productivity.





bargaining gapThe difference between the real wage that firms wish to offer in order to provide workers with incentives to work, and the real wage that allows firms the markup that maximizes profits given the degree of competition.

The big message from the model of inflation and conflict over the pie is that if employment is above or below the labour market equilibrium then the price level is either rising or falling. When the real wage given by the wage-setting curve and that given by the price-setting curve are not equal, we say there is a bargaining gap equal to the vertical distance between the two curves.

If unemployment is lower than at the equilibrium: There is a positive bargaining gap and there is inflation.
If unemployment is higher than at the equilibrium: There is a negative bargaining gap and there is deflation.
If there is labour market equilibrium: The bargaining gap is zero and the price level is constant.

For example, if the wage on the price-setting curve is 100 and on the wage-setting curve it is 101, the bargaining gap is 1%.
The bargaining gap and the Phillips curve
We can summarize the causal chain from the bargaining gap to inflation like this:












Remember, the triple bar indicates that inflation is defined as the percentage increase in prices. So, to work out the inflation rate, we use the following:


Bargaining gap
The difference between the real wage that firms wish to offer in order to provide workers with incentives to work (the wage-setting curve), and the real wage that allows firms the markup on costs required to motivate them to continue in business (the price-setting curve).

When the bargaining gap is positive, the real wage on the wage-setting curve is above the price-setting curve, and the claims of employers and owners to output per worker are inconsistent.
The percentage bargaining gap is equal to the wage on the wage-setting curve, minus the wage on the price-setting curve, divided by the wage on the price-setting curve.


In Figure 15.4c, we draw a new diagram beneath the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve. This is the Phillips curve diagram, with inflation on the vertical axis and employment on the horizontal axis. If we begin with employment at the labour market equilibrium, and inflation of zero, we note that the economy can remain here: there is no pressure for the price level to rise or fall. This gives a point on the Phillips curve. Now consider a higher level of employment due to stronger aggregate demand. A positive bargaining gap opens up and wages and prices will rise. Firms increase wages in response to the fall in unemployment. The price level rises as firms put up their prices in response to the rise in their labour costs. If the bargaining gap is 1%, prices and wages will rise by 1%. This gives a second point on the Phillips curve.

Bargaining gaps, inflation, and the Phillips curve.
        















Labour market equilibrium


The bargaining gap is zero and inflation is zero.














Low unemployment


The bargaining gap is positive and inflation is positive.














High unemployment


The bargaining gap is negative and inflation is negative.




As long as employment remains above the labour market equilibrium, employees will be disappointed at the end of the year. Their real wage will not have risen by 1% as they had anticipated, so they will bargain for another 1% rise. The result: wages and prices will rise by 1% the following year as well: firms will put up wages by 1% to take the real wage up to the wage-setting curve, and they will put up prices by 1% in response to that cost increase. We will observe lower unemployment and higher inflation as in Phillips original empirical scatter plot.
To complete the picture, we include the multiplier model beneath the labour market and Phillips diagrams to bring the short- and medium-run models together. This highlights that:

At a higher level of aggregate demand (a boom) inflation is positive: Unemployment is lower, which means there is a positive bargaining gap, so wages and prices are rising continuously.
At a lower level of aggregate demand (a recession), there is deflation: Unemployment is higher, which means there is a negative bargaining gap.

Labour market equilibrium


When the level of aggregate demand produces employment at labour market equilibrium (a normal level of activity), the price level is stable (inflation is zero).














A boom


At a higher level of aggregate demand (a boom), there is a positive bargaining gap and inflation is positive.














A recession


At a lower level of aggregate demand (a recession), there is a negative bargaining gap and deflation.





Exercise 15.1 The bargaining gap in a recession
Suppose the economy is initially at labour market equilibrium with stable prices (inflation is zero). At the beginning of year 1, investment declines and the economy moves into recession with high unemployment.

Explain why a negative bargaining gap arises.
Assume the negative bargaining gap is 1%. Draw a diagram with years on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis. Starting from a price index of 100, sketch the path of the price level for the 5 years that follow, assuming the bargaining gap remains at 1%.
Who are the winners and losers in this economy?



Exercise 15.2 Positive and negative shocks
Draw a labour market diagram where the economy is at labour market equilibrium with stable prices. Now consider:

A positive shock to aggregate demand that reduces the unemployment rate by 2 percentage points.
A negative shock that increases it by 2 percentage points.

Question 15.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
See Figure 15.4d for diagrams of the labour market model, the Phillips curve, and the multiplier model of aggregate demand. The unemployment rates and the bargaining gaps at different states of the economy are shown.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

There is no inflation when the unemployment rate is zero.
In the boom shown, the upward shift in the aggregate demand curve reduces the unemployment rate, which in turn creates a bargaining gap of 1%.
In the recession shown, the downward shift in the aggregate demand curve increases the unemployment rate, which in turn creates a bargaining gap of 0.5%.
The resulting Phillips curve shows a positive correlation between the unemployment rate and inflation rate.


There is always a positive rate of unemployment in the labour market model (see Unit 9). If U is below 3%, then there would be an even larger positive bargaining gap than with U = 3 and even higher inflation. Inflation is zero in the diagram only when the unemployment rate is 6%.
At point B unemployment is below the labour market equilibrium, creating a positive bargaining gap.
The bargaining gap created as a result of the recession is 0.5%, which is negative.
The Phillips curve shows a positive correlation between employment and the inflation rate, which means a negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.
