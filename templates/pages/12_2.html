12.1 Market failure: External effects of pollution

market failureWhen markets allocate resources in a Pareto-inefficient way.

When markets allocate resources in a Pareto-inefficient way, we describe this as a market failure. We encountered one cause of market failure in Unit 7: a firm producing a differentiated good (such as a car) that chooses its price and output level such that the price is greater than the marginal cost. In contrast, we know from Unit 8 that a competitive market allocation maximizes the total surplus of the producers and consumers, and is Pareto efficient, as long as no one else is affected by the production and consumption of the good.
But the market allocation of the good is unlikely to be Pareto efficient if the decisions of producers and consumers affect others in ways that they do not adequately take into account. This is another cause of market failure. When we analyse gains from trade in such cases, we have to consider not only the consumer and producer surplus, but also the costs or benefits that other parties who are neither buyers nor sellers may experience. For example, the superbug that emerges as a result of the sale and overuse of an antibiotic may kill someone who had no part in the sale and purchase of the antibiotic.
We will analyse the gains from trade in a case where the production of a good creates an external cost: pollution. Our example is based on the real-world case of the plantations use of the pesticide chlordecone to control the banana weevil, which we discussed earlier.

external effectA positive or negative effect of a production, consumption, or other economic decision on another person or people that is not specified as a benefit or liability in a contract. It is called an external effect because the effect in question is outside the contract. Also known as: externality. See also: incomplete contract, market failure, external benefit, external cost.

To see why this is called an external effect (or sometimes an externality), imagine for a minute that the same company owned the banana plantations and fisheries, and hired fishermen and sold what they caught for profit. The owners of the company would decide on the level of pesticide to use, taking account of its downstream effects. They would trade-off the profits from the banana part of their business against the losses from the fisheries.
But this was not the case in Martinique and Guadeloupe. The plantations owned the profits from banana production, which were increased by using pesticide. The fisherman owned the losses from fishing. The pollution effect of the pesticide was external to the people making the decision on its use. Joint ownership of the plantations and fisheries would have internalized this effect, but the plantations and fisheries were under separate ownership.

marginal private cost (MPC)The cost for the producer of producing an additional unit of a good, not taking into account any costs its production imposes on others. See also: marginal external cost, marginal social cost.marginal social cost (MSC)The cost of producing an additional unit of a good, taking into account both the cost for the producer and the costs incurred by others affected by the goods production. Marginal social cost is the sum of the marginal private cost and the marginal external cost.marginal private benefit (MPB)The benefit (in terms of profit, or utility) of producing or consuming an additional unit of a good for the individual who decides to produce or consume it, not taking into account any benefit received by others.marginal social benefit (MSB)The benefit (in terms of utility) of producing or consuming an additional unit of a good, taking into account both the benefit to the individual who decides to produce or consume it, and the benefit to anyone else affected by the decision.

To model the implications of this kind of external effect, Figure 12.1 shows the marginal costs of growing bananas on an imaginary Caribbean island where a fictional pesticide called Weevokil is used. The marginal cost of producing bananas for the growers is labelled as the marginal private cost (MPC). It slopes upward because the cost of an additional tonne of bananas increases as the land is more intensively used, requiring more Weevokil. Use the analysis in Figure 12.1 to compare the MPC with the marginal social cost (MSC), which includes the costs borne by fishermen whose waters are contaminated by Weevokil.

The marginal private cost


The purple line is the marginal cost for the growers: the marginal private cost (MPC) of banana production. It slopes upward because the cost of producing an additional tonne increases as the land is more intensively used, requiring more Weevokil.














The marginal external cost


The orange line shows the marginal cost imposed by the banana growers on fishermenthe marginal external cost (MEC). This is the cost of the reduction in quantity and quality of fish caused by each additional tonne of bananas.














The marginal social cost


Adding together the MPC and the MEC, we get the full marginal cost of banana production: the marginal social cost (MSC). This is the green line in the diagram.














The total external cost


The shaded area in the figure shows the total costs imposed on fishermen by plantations using Weevokil. It is the sum of the differences between the marginal social cost and the marginal private cost at each level of production.




You can see in Figure 12.1 that the marginal social cost of banana production is higher than the marginal private cost. To focus on the essentials, we will consider a case in which the wholesale market for bananas is competitive, and the market price is $400 per tonne. If the banana plantation owners wish to maximize their profit, we know that they will choose their output so that price is equal to their marginal costthat is, the marginal private cost. Figure 12.2 shows that their total output will be 80,000 tonnes of bananas (point A). Although 80,000 tonnes maximizes profits for banana producers, this does not include the cost imposed on the fishing industry, so it is not a Pareto-efficient outcome.

To see this, think about what would happen if the plantations were to produce less. The fishermen would benefit but the owners of the plantations would lose. So on the face of it, it appears that producing 80,000 tonnes must be Pareto efficient. But lets imagine that the fishermen could persuade the plantation owners to produce one tonne less. The fishermen would gain $270they would no longer suffer the loss of revenue from fishing that is caused by the production of the 80,000th tonne of bananas. The plantations would lose hardly anything. Their revenues would fall by $400, but their costs would fall by almost exactly this amount because, when producing 80,000 tonnes, the marginal private cost is equal to the price ($400).
So if the fishermen paid the plantation owners any amount between just greater than zero and just less than $270, both groups would be better off with 79,999 tonnes of bananas.
What about another payment to get the plantations to produce 79,998 tonnes instead? You can see that because the marginal external cost imposed on the fishermen is still much higher than the surplus received by the plantations on the next tonne (the difference between the price and the MPC), such a payment would also make both parties better off.

marginal external cost (MEC)The cost of producing an additional unit of a good that is incurred by anyone other than the producer of the good. See also: marginal private cost, marginal social cost.

By how much could the fishermen persuade the plantations to reduce production? Look at the point in Figure 12.2 at which the price of bananas is equal to the marginal social cost. At this point, 38,000 tonnes of bananas are produced. If the payments by the fishermen to the plantations resulted in them producing just 38,000 tonnes, then the fishermen could no longer benefit by making further payments in return for reduced output. If production were lowered further, the loss to the plantations (the difference between price and marginal cost) would be greater than the gain to the fishermen (the difference between private and social cost, shaded). At this point, the maximum payment the fishermen would be willing to make would not be enough to induce the plantations to cut production further. So 38,000 tonnes is the Pareto-efficient level of banana output.
To summarize:

The plantations produce 80,000 tonnes of bananas: At this point price equals MPC.
The Pareto-efficient level of output is 38,000 tonnes of bananas: Price equals MSC.
When production is 38,000 tonnes it is not possible for the plantations and fishermen to both be made better off.
If a single company owned both the banana plantations and fisheries: This company would choose to produce 38,000 tonnes because, for the single owner, price would be equal to MPC at 38,000 tonnes.

In general, pollutants like Weevokil have negative external effects, sometimes called environmental spillovers. They bring private benefits to those who decide to use them, but by damaging the environmentwater resources, in this casethey impose external costs on other firms or on households that rely on environmental resources. For society as a whole, this is a market failure: compared with the Pareto-efficient allocation, the pollutant is overused, and too much of the associated good (bananas, in our example) is produced.

Question 12.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
A factory is situated next to a dormitory for nurses who work night shifts. The factory produces 120 humanoid robots a day. The production process is rather noisy, and the nurses often complain that their sleep is disturbed. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The marginal private cost is the factorys total cost of producing 120 robots a day.
The marginal social cost is the noise cost incurred by the nurses from production of an additional robot.
The marginal external cost is the cost to the factory, plus the noise cost incurred by the nurses, when an additional robot is produced.
The total external cost is the total costs per day imposed on the nurses by the factorys production.


The MPC is the factorys cost of producing one additional robot, not the total cost.
The MSC is the sum of the costs to the factory and the nurses of producing the additional robot, MSC = MPC + MEC.
The MEC is the noise cost incurred by the nurses when an additional robot is produced.
The total external cost is the sum of the marginal external costs of production of all the robots. This is the total cost imposed on the nurses.
