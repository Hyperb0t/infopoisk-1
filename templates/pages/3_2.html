3.1 Labour and production
In Unit 2 we saw that labour can be thought of as an input in the production of goods and services. Labour is work; for example the welding, assembling, and testing required to make a car. Work activity is often difficult to measure, which is an important point in later units because employers find it difficult to determine the exact amount of work that their employees are doing. We also cannot measure the effort required by different activities in a comparable way (for example, baking a cake versus building a car), so economists often measure labour simply as the number of hours worked by individuals engaged in production, and assume that as the number of hours worked increases, the amount of goods produced also increases.
As a student, you make a choice every day: how many hours to spend studying. There may be many factors influencing your choice: how much you enjoy your work, how difficult you find it, how much work your friends do, and so on. Perhaps part of the motivation to devote time to studying comes from your belief that the more time you spend studying, the higher the grade you will be able to obtain at the end of the course. In this unit, we will construct a simple model of a students choice of how many hours to work, based on the assumption that the more time spent working, the better the final grade will be.
We assume a positive relationship between hours worked and final grade, but is there any evidence to back this up? A group of educational psychologists looked at the study behaviour of 84 students at Florida State University to identify the factors that affected their performance.1
At first sight there seems to be only a weak relationship between the average number of hours per week the students spent studying and their Grade Point Average (GPA) at the end of the semester. This is in Figure 3.3.
The 84 students have been split into two groups according to their hours of study. The average GPA for those with high study time is 3.43only just above the GPA of those with low study time.

Elizabeth Ashby Plant, Karl Anders Ericsson, Len Hill, and Kia Asberg. 2005. Why study time does not predict grade point average across college students: Implications of deliberate practice for academic performance. Contemporary Educational Psychology 30 (1): pp.96116. Additional calculations were conducted by Ashby Plant, Florida State University, in June 2015.



Looking more closely, we discover this study is an interesting illustration of why we should be careful when we make ceteris paribus assumptions (remember from Unit 2 that this means holding other things constant). Within each group of 42 students there are many potentially important differences. The conditions in which they study would be an obvious difference to consider: an hour working in a busy, noisy room may not be as useful as an hour spent in the library.
In Figure 3.4, we see that students studying in poor environments are more likely to study longer hours. Of these 42 students, 31 of them have high study time, compared with only 11 of the students with good environments. Perhaps they are distracted by other people around them, so it takes them longer to complete their assignments than students who work in the library.

Plant et al. Why study time does not predict grade point average across college students, ibid.



Now look at the average GPAs in the top row: if the environment is good, students who study longer do betterand you can see in the bottom row that high study time pays off for those who work in poor environments too. This relationship was not as clear when we didnt consider the effect of the study environment.
So, after taking into account environment and other relevant factors (including the students past GPAs, and the hours they spent in paid work or partying), the psychologists estimated that an additional hour of study time per week raised a students GPA at the end of the semester by 0.24 points on average. If we take two students who are the same in all respects except for study time, we predict that the one who studies for longer will have a GPA that is 0.24 points higher for each extra hour: study time raises GPA by 0.24 per hour, ceteris paribus.

Exercise 3.1 Ceteris paribus assumptions
You have been asked to conduct a research study at your university, just like the one at Florida State University.

In addition to study environment, which factors do you think should ideally be held constant in a model of the relationship between study hours and final grade?
What information about the students would you want to collect beyond GPA, hours of study, and study environment?


Now imagine a student, whom we will call Alexei. He can vary the number of hours he spends studying. We will assume that, as in the Florida study, the hours he spends studying over the semester will increase the percentage grade that he will receive at the end, ceteris paribus. This relationship between study time and final grade is represented in the table in Figure 3.5. In this model, study time refers to all of the time that Alexei spends learning, whether in class or individually, measured per day (not per week, as for the Florida students). The table shows how his grade will vary if he changes his study hours, if all other factorshis social life, for exampleare held constant.

production functionA graphical or mathematical expression describing the amount of output that can be produced by any given amount or combination of input(s). The function describes differing technologies capable of producing the same thing.

This is Alexeis production function: it translates the number of hours per day spent studying (his input of labour) into a percentage grade (his output). In reality, the final grade might also be affected by unpredictable events (in everyday life, we normally lump the effect of these things together and call it luck). You can think of the production function as telling us what Alexei will get under normal conditions (if he is neither lucky nor unlucky).
If we plot this relationship on a graph, we get the curve in Figure 3.5. Alexei can achieve a higher grade by studying more, so the curve slopes upward. At 15 hours of work per day he gets the highest grade he is capable of, which is 90%. Any time spent studying beyond that does not affect his exam result (he will be so tired that studying more each day will not achieve anything), and the curve becomes flat.

average productTotal output divided by a particular input, for example per worker (divided by the number of workers) or per worker per hour (total output divided by the total number of hours of labour put in).

We can calculate Alexeis average product of labour, as we did for the farmers in Unit 2. If he works for 4 hours per day, he achieves a grade of 50. The average productthe average number of percentage points per hour of studyis 50/4 =12.5. In Figure 3.5 it is the slope of a ray from the origin to the curve at 4 hours per day:


marginal productThe additional amount of output that is produced if a particular input was increased by one unit, while holding all other inputs constant.

Alexeis marginal product is the increase in his grade from increasing study time by one hour. Follow the steps in Figure 3.5 to see how to calculate the marginal product, and compare it with the average product.

Increasing study time from 4 to 5 hours


Increasing study time from 4 to 5 hours raises Alexeis grade from 50 to 57. Therefore, at 4 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 7.

Increasing study time from 10 to 11 hours raises Alexeis grade from 81 to 84. At 10 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 3. As we move along the curve, the slope of the curve falls, so the marginal product of an extra hour falls. The marginal product is diminishing.

The marginal product is lower than the average product


At 4 hours per day the average product is 12.5. At 10 hours per day it is lower (81/10 = 8.1). The average product falls as we move along the curve. At each point the marginal product (the slope of the curve) is lower than the average product (the slope of the ray).

The marginal product is the slope of the tangent


The marginal product at four hours of study is approximately 7, which is the increase in the grade from one more hour of study. More precisely, the marginal product is the slope of the tangent at that point, which is slightly higher than 7.




At each point on the production function, the marginal product is the increase in the grade from studying one more hour. The marginal product corresponds to the slope of the production function.
Leibniz: Average and marginal productivity

diminishing returnsA situation in which the use of an additional unit of a factor of production results in a smaller increase in output than the previous increase. Also known as: diminishing marginal returns in production

Alexeis production function in Figure 3.5 gets flatter the more hours he studies, so the marginal product of an additional hour falls as we move along the curve. The marginal product is diminishing. The model captures the idea that an extra hour of study helps a lot if you are not studying much, but if you are already studying a lot, then studying even more does not help very much.
Leibniz: Diminishing marginal productivity

concave functionA function of two variables for which the line segment between any two points on the function lies entirely below the curve representing the function (the function is convex when the line segment lies above the function).

In Figure 3.5, output increases as the input increases, but the marginal product fallsthe function becomes gradually flatter. A production function with this shape is described as concave.
Leibniz: Concave and convex functions
If we compare the marginal and average products at any point on Alexeis production function, we find that the marginal product is below the average product. For example, when he works for four hours his average product is 50/4 = 12.5 points per hour, but an extra hours work raises his grade from 50 to 57, so the marginal product is 7. This happens because the marginal product is diminishing: each hour is less productive than the ones that came before. And it implies that the average product is also diminishing: each additional hour of study per day lowers the average product of all his study time, taken as a whole.
This is another example of the diminishing average product of labour that we saw in Unit 2. In that case, the average product of labour in food production (the food produced per worker) fell as more workers cultivated a fixed area of land.
Lastly, notice that if Alexei was already studying for 15 hours a day, the marginal product of an additional hour would be zero. Studying more would not improve his grade. As you might know from experience, a lack of either sleep or time to relax could even lower Alexeis grade if he worked more than 15 hours a day. If this were the case, then his production function would start to slope downward, and Alexeis marginal product would become negative.

tangencyWhen two curves share one point in common but do not cross. The tangent to a curve at a given point is a straight line that touches the curve at that point but does not cross it.

Marginal change is an important and common concept in economics. You will often see it marked as a slope on a diagram. With a production function like the one in Figure 3.5, the slope changes continuously as we move along the curve. We have said that when Alexei studies for 4 hours a day the marginal product is 7, the increase in the grade from one more hour of study. Because the slope of the curve changes between 4 and 5 hours on the horizontal axis, this is only an approximation to the actual marginal product. More precisely, the marginal product is the rate at which the grade increases, per hour of additional study. In Figure 3.5 the true marginal product is the slope of the tangent to the curve at 4 hours. In this unit, we will use approximations so that we can work in whole numbers, but you may notice that sometimes these numbers are not quite the same as the slopes.

Exercise 3.2 Production functions

Draw a graph to show a production function that, unlike Alexeis, becomes steeper as the input increases.
Can you think of an example of a production process that might have this shape? Why would the slope get steeper?
What can you say about the marginal and average products in this case?



Marginal product
The marginal product is the rate of change of the grade at 4 hours of study. Suppose Alexei has been studying for 4 hours a day, and studies for 1 minute longer each day (a total of 4.016667 hours). Then, according to the graph, his grade will rise by a very small amountabout 0.124. A more precise estimate of the marginal product (the rate of change) would be:

If we looked at smaller changes in study time even further (the rise in grade for each additional second of study per day, for example) we would get closer to the true marginal product, which is the slope of the tangent to the curve at 4 hours of study.


Question 3.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 3.5 shows Alexeis production function, with the final grade (the output) related to the number of hours spent studying (the input).
Which of the following is true?

The marginal product and average product are approximately the same for the initial hour.
The marginal product and the average product are both constant beyond 15 hours.
The horizontal production function beyond 15 hours means that studying for more than 15 hours is detrimental to Alexeis performance.
The marginal product and the average product at 20 hours are both 4.5.


Because there are no previous hours to consider, the average product for the initial hour is just the improvement produced by a single hour, which in turn approximates to the marginal product from 0 to 1 hours (the precise marginal product changes over this interval, reflected in the decreasing slope of the production function).
The marginal product is constant beyond 15 hours, but the average product continues to diminish. This is because the marginal product (zero) is less than the average product, which remains positive but is decreasing (more hours with no additional improvement reduces the average).
If studying for more than 15 hours had a negative effect on Alexeis grade, then the marginal product would be negative, implying a downward-sloping curve beyond 15 hours.
The average product at 20 hours is 90 grade points/20 hours = 4.5 points per hour. The marginal product, however, is zero  as indicated by the production function being flat beyond 15 hours.
