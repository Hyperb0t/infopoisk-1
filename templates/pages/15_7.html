15.6 Expected inflation and the Phillips curve
We now explain why the Phillips curve shifts: why does inflation keep rising when governments try to keep unemployment too low? We will show that there is only one unemployment rate at which inflation is stable, and that this is the labour market Nash equilibrium.
We need to go back to two familiar points:

People are forward-looking: We explained this in Units 6, 9, 10 and 13. They take actions now in anticipation of things they expect to happen. To stress this, economists say that expectations matter.
People treat prices as messages: Friedrich Hayek taught us this (see Unit 11). Therefore people also treat changes in prices as messages about what will happen in the future, just as people treat a build-up of clouds as a prediction of rain.


expected inflationThe opinion that wage- and price-setters form about the level of inflation in the next period. See also: inflation.

With these two building blocks, we can see why Friedman was right. As well as the battle for the pie between workers and the owners of firms that is the fundamental cause of rising prices, Friedman showed that, at low unemployment, inflation keeps increasing. This is because of the way that wage- and price-setters form their views about what will happen to inflation, which is called expected inflation. The behaviour of inflation will reflect both elements.
Introducing expected inflation
We introduce the role of expected inflation by returning to the Phillips curve.
Look at Figure 15.7. You will notice that at the labour market equilibrium with an unemployment rate of 6%, the inflation rate is 3% and not zero as in Figure 15.4d.
If wage- and price-setters expect prices to rise by 3% per annum, and the level of aggregate demand is normal and keeps unemployment at 6%, then the economy can remain at the labour market equilibrium with inflation remaining constant at 3% per annum. Every year, wages and prices will rise by 3% and the real wage will remain at the intersection of the wage- and price-setting curves. This is point A.












Figure 15.7 
Bargaining gaps, expected inflation, and the Phillips curve.
        















Labour market equilibrium


At labour market equilibrium, inflation is 3% as expected.














A boom


At lower unemployment, the bargaining gap is 2%.














The new rate of inflation, 5%


At B, inflation is equal to expected inflation plus the bargaining gap.




Now consider a boom, which takes the economy to lower unemployment at point B. What will happen to inflation? Workers expect prices to rise by 3% and will require a nominal wage increase of 3% just to keep their real wage unchanged. But they require an additional 2% rise to give them an expected real wage rise on the wage-setting curve, so wages increase by 5%. With their costs rising by 5%, firms will increase prices by 5%. In the boom, inflation will be 5%. This gives a Phillips curve like the one we have seen before. The only difference is that inflation at labour market equilibrium is 3% rather than zero.
When inflation is not zero, we can summarize the causal chain from expected inflation and the bargaining gap to inflation like this:












To work out the inflation rate:

But Friedman pointed out that with low unemployment, inflation would not remain at 5% at point B. To see why, we ask what happens next.
The shifting Phillips curve
With low unemployment continuing, workers will be disappointed with the outcome, since they did not achieve their expected real wage. Why not? Workers expected a 2% real wage increase at B from their nominal pay rise of 5% (to give the real wage on the wage-setting curve), but they did not get this because firms raised their prices by 5%.
But the story does not end there. We know that both parties cannot be satisfied with the outcome at low unemployment, because their claims add up to more than the size of the pie. Now, we assume that workers expect inflation next year to be equal to inflation last year. So at the next wage-setting round, the human resources department has to take into account the fact that their employees expect prices to rise by 5%. Another interpretation is that HR includes inflation over the past year in the wage settlement, to make up for the shortfall in the real wage that workers experienced because inflation turned out to be higher than expected. So in order to achieve another real wage increase of 2%, the HR department sets a wage increase of 7%. The process continues with the rate of inflation increasing over time.
The table in Figure 15.8 summarizes the situation. We compare the situation over a three-year period with unemployment at two levels: 6% and 3%.

Figure 15.8 
Unstable Phillips curves: Expected inflation and the bargaining gap.
        




The first column of Figure 15.8 reflects forward-looking behaviour. Expected inflation over the year ahead is based on the previous years inflation. The second column shows the unemployment rate. The third column shows the bargaining gap. The fourth column is the inflation outcome, which reflects expectations and the bargaining gap.
We can summarize the causal chain from the last periods inflation rate to this periods inflation rate like this:












To work out the inflation rate:

We can show the data in the table in Figure 15.8 and in the Phillips curve and labour market diagrams in Figure 15.9. The stable inflation case is at point A with unemployment of 6% and inflation of 3%, year after year. At low unemployment (3%), the Phillips curve shifts up from the one through point B to the one through point C when expected inflation rises from 3% to 5%.












Figure 15.9 
Inflation expectations and Phillips curves.
        















Labour market equilibrium at A


Inflation is 3% as expected.














A boom: First period at B


At lower unemployment, the bargaining gap is 2%. Inflation is equal to expected inflation plus the bargaining gap.














A boom: Next period at C


Next period, with unemployment still low at 3%, inflation is equal to expected inflation plus the bargaining gap. The Phillips curve has shifted up because expected inflation increased.





inflation-stabilizing rate of unemploymentThe unemployment rate (at labour market equilibrium) at which inflation is constant. Originally known as the natural rate of unemployment. Also known as: non-accelerating rate of unemployment, stable inflation rate of unemployment. See also: equilibrium unemployment.

By plotting the path of inflation over time in Figure 15.10 we can see the distinctive contributions of the bargaining gap and expected inflation to inflation. In this example, the bargaining gap opens up in year 1 because of the move to low unemployment. The assumption that unemployment remains below the inflation-stabilizing rate is reflected in the persistence of the bargaining gap. Inflation rises in every period because the previous periods inflation feeds into expected inflation and therefore into wage and price inflation. Note that the real wage does not change, but remains on the price-setting curve.

Inflation, expected inflation, and the bargaining gap.
        















A zero bargaining gap


Inflation is as expected: 3%.














Year 1


At the start of year 1 following the opening up of the bargaining gap and after wages and prices have been adjusted, inflation is equal to the bargaining gap (2%) plus expected inflation (3%).














Year 2


At the start of year 2, with no change in the bargaining gap, inflation goes up to 7%, equal to the bargaining gap plus expected inflation.














 and each year afterwards


As long as the bargaining gap remains unchanged, inflation rises each year.





Exercise 15.4 A negative aggregate demand shock with high unemployment
Copy Figure 15.9, making sure you leave plenty of space to the left of the 6% unemployment marker. Assume that from an initial position at A, there is a negative shock to private sector demand such as depressed private investment, which raises unemployment to 9%.

Show the inflation, expected inflation, and the bargaining gap at the new level of unemployment on your diagram.
What do you predict will happen to inflation over the following two years, assuming there is no further change in unemployment?
Draw the Phillips curves and write a brief explanation of your findings.



Exercise 15.5 Inflation, expected inflation, and the bargaining gap
Use the same axes as in Figure 15.10 to plot inflation, expected inflation, and the bargaining gap in a single diagram. Assume that the price level is constant in period zero. The economy is hit by a recession at the beginning of period 1 and unemployment remains at a constant high level until the beginning of period 6.

Plot the path of the bargaining gap.
Plot the path of inflation and expected inflation.
Give a brief explanation of why the bargaining gap might have disappeared and state any other assumptions you are making. Summarize your findings.



Question 15.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 15.6 is a scatter plot of the inflation rate and the unemployment rate for the US for each year between 1960 and 2014.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The Phillips curve is stable over the years.
The Phillips curve shifted higher over the period.
In the 1960s, the Phillips curve suggests a trade-off of a 2% fall in the unemployment rate and a 23% rise in the inflation rate.
In the most recent period, the US economy has been able to lower its inflation rate with little effect on the unemployment rate.


This is clearly not true from the graph.
The Phillips curve shifted higher until the 1980s, but shifted lower in the 1990s-2010s.
This reflects the slope of the Phillips curve in the 1960s.
On the contrary, a flatter Phillips curve means that a small fall in the inflation rate is associated with a large rise in the unemployment rate. However this also means that a relatively large fall in the unemployment rate is associated with only a small rise in the inflation rate.



Question 15.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 15.9 depicts the diagrams of the labour market model and the Phillips curve that incorporates inflation expectations.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The labour market equilibrium occurs at zero inflation and 6% unemployment rate.
With the fall in the unemployment rate to 3%, the Phillips curve shifts up immediately.
The bargaining gap returns to zero after the first round of wage- and price-setting.
Upward shifts of the Phillips curve represent a rising inflation rate for a given unemployment rate.


In this diagram the labour market equilibrium occurs at 3% inflation on the lower of the two Phillips curves. But at the labour market equilibrium of 6% unemployment, inflation will be constant whatever level it starts at. The Phillips curve will not shift up when the economy is at labour market equilibrium.
With unemployment at 3%, initially the wage rises to 5% along the Phillips curve. The shift in the curve occurs in the next stage when the previous periods inflation feeds into the next periods expected inflation.
With the unemployment rate stable at 3%, the bargaining gap remains at 2%. This causes the further rises in the inflation rate.
The Phillips curve continues to shift upwards as long as there is a positive bargaining gap, caused by the low unemployment rate.
