5.8 The Pareto efficiency curve and the distribution of the surplus
Angela chose to work for 8 hours, producing 9 bushels of grain, both when she had to pay rent, and also when she did not. In both cases there is a surplus of 4.5 bushels: the difference between the amount of grain produced, and the amount that would give Angela her reservation utility.
The two cases differ in who gets the surplus. When Angela had to pay land rent, Bruno took the whole surplus, but when she could work the land for herself she obtained all of the surplus. Both allocations have two important properties:

All the grain produced is shared between Angela and Bruno.
The MRT on the feasible frontier is equal to the MRS on Angelas indifference curve.

This means that the allocations are Pareto efficient.
To see why, remember that Pareto efficiency means that no Pareto improvement is possible: it is impossible to change the allocation to make one party better off without making the other worse off.
The first property is straightforward: it means that no Pareto improvement can be achieved simply by changing the amounts of grain they each consume. If one consumed more, the other would have to have less. On the other hand, if some of the grain produced was not being consumed, then consuming it would make one or both of them better off.
The second property, MRS = MRT, means that no Pareto improvement can be achieved by changing Angelas hours of work and hence the amount of grain produced.
If the MRS and MRT were not equal, it would be possible to make both better off. For example, if MRT > MRS, Angela could transform an hour of her time into more grain than she would need to get the same utility as before, so the extra grain could make both of them better off. But if MRT = MRS, then any change in the amount of grain produced would only be exactly what is needed to keep Angelas utility the same as before, given the change in her hours.
Figure 5.8 shows that there are many other Pareto-efficient allocations in addition to these two. Point C is the outcome when Angela is an independent farmer. Compare the analysis in Figure 5.8 with Brunos take-or-leave-it offer, and see the other Pareto-efficient allocations.

The allocation at C


As an independent farmer, Angela chose point C, where MRT = MRS. She consumed 9 bushels of grain: 4.5 bushels would have been enough to put her on her reservation indifference curve at D. But she obtained the whole surplus CDan additional 4.5 bushels.














The allocation at D


When Bruno owned the land and made a take-it-or-leave-it offer, he chose a contract in which the land rent was CD (4.5 bushels). Angela accepted and worked 8 hours. The allocation was at D, and once again, MRT = MRS. The surplus was still CD, but Bruno got it all.














Angelas preferences


Remember that Angelas MRS doesnt change as she consumes more grain. At any point along the line CD, such as G, there is an indifference curve with the same slope. So MRS = MRT at all of these points.














A hypothetical allocation


Point G is a hypothetical allocation, at which MRS = MRT. Angela works for 8hours, and 9 bushels of grain are produced. Bruno gets grain CG, and Angela gets all the rest. Allocation G is Pareto efficient.














The Pareto efficiency curve


All the points making up the line between C and D are Pareto-efficient allocations, at which MRS = MRT. The surplus of 4.5 bushels (CD) is shared between Angela and Bruno.





Pareto efficiency and the Pareto efficiency curve

A Pareto-efficient allocation has the property that there is no alternative technically feasible allocation in which at least one person would be better off, and nobody worse off.
The set of all such allocations is the Pareto efficiency curve. It is also referred to as the contract curve.


Figure 5.8 shows that in addition to the two Pareto-efficient allocations we have observed (C and D), every point between C and D represents a Pareto-efficient allocation. CD is called the Pareto efficiency curve: it joins together all the points in the feasible set for which MRS = MRT. (You will also hear it called the contract curve, even in situations where there is no contract, which is why we prefer the more descriptive term Pareto efficiency curve.)
Leibniz: The Pareto efficiency curve
At each allocation on the Pareto efficiency curve Angela works for 8hours and there is a surplus of 4.5 bushels, but the distribution of the surplus is differentranging from point D where Angela gets none of it, to point C where she gets it all. At the hypothetical allocation G, both receive an economic rent: Angelas rent is GD, Brunos is GC, and the sum of their rents is equal to the surplus.

Question 5.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.8 shows the Pareto efficiency curve CD for the interaction between Angela and Bruno.
Which of the following statements is correct?

The allocation at C Pareto dominates the one at D.
Angelas marginal rate of substitution is equal to the marginal rate of transformation at all points on the Pareto efficiency curve.
The mid-point of CD is the most Pareto-efficient allocation.
Angela and Bruno are indifferent between all the points on CD, because they are all Pareto efficient.


All points on CD are Pareto efficient, so none of them is Pareto dominated. (Comparing C and D, we see that Bruno prefers D and Angela prefers C.)
The Pareto efficiency curve, by definition, joins all the economically feasible points where MRS = MRT.
All the points on CD are Pareto efficient. It does not make any sense to say that one point on CD is more efficient than another.
All the points on CD are Pareto efficient, but Bruno and Angela are not indifferent. Some points (like C) are better for Angela, while others (like D) are better for Bruno.
