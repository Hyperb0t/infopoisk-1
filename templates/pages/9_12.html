9.11 Labour market policies to address unemployment and inequality
Like when we studied the effect of taxes on prices and quantities of goods in Unit 8, we now use the labour market model we have constructed (the two curves) to see how a policy change will shift one or both of these curves. The effect of a policy is determined by how it changes the point of intersection of the two curves.
The objectives of labour market policies typically include reducing unemployment and raising wages (particularly of the least well off). Later (in Units 1316) we will see that other objectives include reducing the economic insecurity to which families are exposed because of periods of unemployment.
The effect of policies that shift the price-setting curve
Education and training
Consider an improvement in the quality of education and training that future employees receive, which increases the productivity of labour. What is the effect of this productivity increase on real wages and equilibrium employment?
The markup chosen by the firm when it sets its price to maximize its profits is determined by the amount of competition that the firm faces, so it is unaffected by the increase in productivity.
This markup determines the distribution of the firms revenue between the employees and the owners, and so this has not changed eitherwages remain the same fraction of revenue. So since the firms output per worker has risen, real wages and the price-setting curve must also rise. The outcome is a rise in both equilibrium employment and the real wage.
A wage subsidy
A policy that has been advocated to increase employment is a subsidy paid to firms in proportion to the wages it pays its workers. For example, suppose that hiring a worker for an hour would cost the firm $40 in wages, but it would receive a 10% subsidy of that amount from the government, or $4. So the net wage cost to the firm would now be $36.
How would this affect the price-setting curve? The costs of the firm have now fallen, but as above, the optimal markup that the firm will use to determine its price has not changed, so the firm will lower its price to restore the old markup. When all firms do this, the prices of goods that the worker consumes fall, and real wages rise.
The effect, as above, is to shift upwards the price-setting curve. In both caseseducation and training or a wage subsidythe effect is to move the new labour market equilibrium up and right along with wage-setting curve to both higher wages and greater employment in the economy as a whole.
The full effect of each of these policies would have to take account of how the education and training or the wage subsidy were financed, but to allow a simple illustration of how the model works here, we assume that the funds necessary for these programs could be raised without affecting the labour market.
The effect of policies that shift the wage-setting curve
An example of how economic policy affects the wage-setting curve is shown in Figure 9.26. Throughout this example, the unemployment rate is held constant at 12% and we vary the unemployment benefit to which the worker is entitled. A higher unemployment benefit increases the reservation wage and shifts the best response curve to the right: the higher reservation wage at a higher unemployment benefit level is shown by point G. The employer sets a higher wage (point C). Work through the steps to see what happens to the wage-setting curve and unemployment.

The firm sets the wage


When unemployment is 12%, and the unemployment benefit is low, the firm sets the wage at point A in the upper panel, which corresponds to point A in the lower panel.














Higher unemployment benefit


There is a new wage-setting curve, which goes through point C.














The price-setting curve


We introduce the price-setting curve to find the labour market equilibrium. With the low unemployment benefit the equilibrium unemployment rate is 5% at D, but with the higher unemployment benefit the rate rises to 12% at C.




There are policies that would affect the third curve in the figure (the labour supply curve). We have already seen how immigration policies could affect the supply of labour and hence the workings of the labour market. Other policies affecting the supply of labour include policies to enhance womens employment opportunities such as subsidized childcare, and a reduction in discrimination against disadvantaged minorities. These policies work initially by increasing the pool of people without jobs and therefore shifting downwards the wage-setting curve, as in the case of immigration.
