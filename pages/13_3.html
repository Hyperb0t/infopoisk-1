13.2 Output growth and changes in unemployment
We saw in Figure 13.3 that unemployment goes down in booms and up in recessions.

Okuns lawThe empirical regularity that growth of GDP is negatively correlated with the rate of unemployment. See also: Okuns coefficient.

Figure 13.5 shows the relationship between output and unemployment fluctuations, known as Okuns law. Arthur Okun, an advisor to US President Kennedy, noticed that when a countrys output growth was high, unemployment tended to decrease. Okuns law has been a strong and stable empirical relationship in most economies since the Second World War.2

Okuns coefficientThe change in the unemployment rate in percentage points predicted to be associated with a 1% change in GDP. For example, an Okun coefficient of -0.4 means that a fall in output of 1% is predicted to be associated with a rise in the unemployment rate of 0.4 percentage points. See also: Okuns law.

Figure 13.5 plots the change in the unemployment rate (vertical axis) and the growth rate of output (horizontal axis) for six countries: lower output growth is clearly associated with a larger increase in unemployment. In each country chart, there is a downward-sloping line that best fits the points. In the US, for example, the slope of the line implies that, on average, a 1% fall in output raises the unemployment rate by roughly 0.37 percentage points. We say that Okuns coefficient is 0.37 in the US.
The dot labeled 2009 in each graph in Figure 13.5 shows the changes in real GDP and unemployment that occurred from 2008 to 2009, during the recession that followed the global financial crisis. We can see that in 2009, all four of the advanced economies experienced their worst output contraction in 50 years. As predicted by Okuns law, unemployment rose in Spain, Japan, and the US.
In each of these three countries, however, the increase in unemployment was higher than Okuns law predicted: the red dot is well above the black line of best fit. Germany looks very different: Okuns law predicted a rise in unemployment of 1.50 percentage points in Germany but, as the red dot shows, German unemployment hardly changed in 2009. An economic policymaker would surely want to know how Germany managed to protect jobs in the face of the largest decline in the economys output in 50 years. We will see why this occurred later in this unit. Our Einstein at the end of this section shows how to predict the rise in unemployment associated with a change in GDP using Okuns relationship.
Brazil and Malaysia also experienced contractions in output and increases in unemployment in 2009. However, like most developing economies, they were hit less hard by the crisis than the advanced economies. Also, Malaysia had experienced a much worse contraction during the East Asian crisis in 1998, when growth was 7.4%bad enough that it would not fit on our chart.
We can summarize the relationship between output, unemployment, and wellbeing like this:













Exercise 13.3 Okuns Law

Look at the regression lines (the lines of best fit) in Figure 13.5. What prediction does the regression line show for unemployment when the economy is not growing? Are the results the same for all the countries?
Assume that the population in the economy is growing. Can you use this assumption to provide an explanation for your results in question 1? What else might explain the differences between countries?



Question 13.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following graph shows the relationship between real GDP growth and change in unemployment for the US between 1961 and 2019.












The equation shown is the regression result for the best-fitting line. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The unemployment rate remains stable when there is zero real GDP growth.
Okuns coefficient for the US is 1.0827.
From the regression result, policy makers can be sure that a 1% increase in real GDP next year will definitely lead to a fall in the unemployment rate of 0.37 percentage points.
With real GDP falling by 2.8% in 2009, the predicted rise in the unemployment rate would have been 2.11 percentage points.


The graph shows an increase in the unemployment rate when there is zero real GDP growth. Indeed the intercept of the best fitting line with the vertical axis is given as 1.0827 percentage points.
Okuns coefficient is 0.3671, that is, a 1% increase in output decreases the unemployment rate by 0.37 percentage points on average.
That is the best fitting regression resultthat on average the unemployment rate has fallen 0.37 percentage points for every 1% increase in the real GDP. This does not mean that this will happen next year with certainty.
This can be inferred from the line or from the equation for the line. The predicted change in the unemployment rate = 1.0827 + (-0.3671)  (-2.8) = 2.11 percentage points.



Einstein Okuns law
The Okuns law relationship is defined as:

ut is the change in unemployment rate at time t, (GDP growtht) is the real GDP growth at time t,  is the intercept value, and  is a coefficient indicating the predicted effect of real GDP growth on changes in the unemployment rate. Okuns law is an empirical linear relationship that associates the percentage change in GDP from the previous year with the change in the unemployment rate from the previous year in percentage points. The coefficient , called Okuns coefficient, is generally found to be negative, suggesting that a positive real GDP growth will be associated with a fall in the unemployment rate.
The estimated Okuns law relationship for Germany, for the period 19712019, has coefficients  = 0.19 and  = 0.42.
When we estimate a line of best fit, we also measure the R-squared (R2), which is a statistic that lies between 0 and 1. It measures how closely the observed data fits the line that we draw through them, with 1 being a perfect fit, and 0 representing no observable relationship between the observations and the prediction. In our case, the R2 statistic measures how well Okuns law approximates the data for real GDP growth and unemployment changes. The R2 statistic is 0.20 for Germany for the period 19712019, which is much lower than for the estimated Okuns law equation for the US, which is 0.60.
To work out the predicted percentage change in unemployment for Germany in 2009 using the Okuns law equation, we simply plug in the value of real GDP growth for Germany in 2009 and solve the equation as follows:

Okuns law predicts that the fall in GDP of 5.7% in 2009 in Germany should have been associated with an increase in unemployment by 1.50 percentage points.
