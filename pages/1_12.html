1.11 Economics and the economy

economicsThe study of how people interact with each other and with their natural surroundings in providing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time.

Economics is the study of how people interact with each other and with their natural surroundings in producing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time. Therefore it is about:

How we come to acquire the things that make up our livelihood: Things like food, clothing, shelter, or free time.
How we interact with each other: Either as buyers and sellers, employees or employers, citizens and public officials, parents, children and other family members.
How we interact with our natural environment: From breathing, to extracting raw materials from the earth.
How each of these changes over time.

In Figure 1.5 we showed that the economy is part of society, which in turn is part of the biosphere. Figure 1.12 shows the position of firms and families in the economy, and the flows that occur within the economy and between the economy and the biosphere. Firms combine labour with structures and equipment, and produce goods and services that are used by households and other firms.

A model of the economy: Households and firms.
        




Production of goods and services also takes place within households, although unlike firms, households may not sell their outputs in the market.
In addition to producing goods and services, households are also producing peoplethe next generation of the labour force. The labour of parents, caregivers and others is combined with structures (for example, your home) and equipment (for example, the oven in that home) to reproduce and raise the future labour force working in firms, and the people who will work and reproduce in the households of the future.
All of this takes place as part of a biological and physical system in which firms and households make use of our natural surroundings and resources, ranging from fossil-fuel or renewable energy to the air we breathe. In the process, households and firms transform nature by using its resources, but also by producing inputs to nature. Currently, some of the most important of these inputs are the greenhouse gases, which contribute to the climate change problems that we saw in Section 1.5.

Exercise 1.11 Where and when would you choose to have been born?
Suppose you can choose to be born in any time period in any of the countries in Figure 1.1a, 1.10 or 1.11, but you know that you would be among the poorest 10% in the population.

In which country would you choose to be born?
Now suppose, instead, you know you would initially be among the poorest 10% in the population, but you would have a fifty-fifty chance of moving to the top 10% of the population if you work hard. In which country would you now choose to be born?
Now suppose that you can only decide on the country and time period of your birth. You cannot be sure if you would be born in the city or the countryside, would be male or female, rich or poor. In which time and country would you choose to be born?
For the scenario in (3), in which time and country you would least want to be born?

Use what you have learned from this unit to explain your choices.
