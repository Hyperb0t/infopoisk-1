4.8 Behavioural experiments in the lab and in the field
To understand economic behaviour, we need to know about peoples preferences. In the previous unit, for example, students and farmers valued free time. How much they valued it was part of the information we needed to predict how much time they spend studying and farming.

revealed preferenceA way of studying preferences by reverse engineering the motives of an individual (her preferences) from observations about her or his actions.

In the past, economists have learned about our preferences from:

Survey questions: To determine political preferences, brand loyalty, degree of trust of others, or religious orientation.
Statistical studies of economic behaviour: For example, purchases of one or more goods when the relative price variesto determine preferences for the goods in question. One strategy is to reverse-engineer what the preferences must have been, as revealed by purchases. This is called revealed preference.

Surveys have a problem. Asking someone if they like ice cream will probably get an honest answer. But the answer to the question: How altruistic are you? may be a mixture of truth, self-advertising, and wishful thinking. Statistical studies cannot control the decision-making environment in which the preferences were revealed, so it is difficult to compare the choices of different groups.
This is why economists sometimes use experiments, so that peoples behaviour can be observed under controlled conditions.

How economists learn from facts Laboratory experiments
Behavioural experiments have become important in the empirical study of preferences. Part of the motivation for experiments is that understanding someones motivations (altruism, reciprocity, inequality aversion as well as self-interest) is essential to being able to predict how they will behave as employees, family members, custodians of the environment, and citizens.
Experiments measure what people do rather than what they say. Experiments are designed to be as realistic as possible, while controlling the situation:

Decisions have consequences: The decisions in the experiment may decide how much money the subjects earn by taking part. Sometimes the stakes can be as high as a months income.
Instructions, incentives and rules are common to all subjects: There is also a common treatment. This means that if we want to compare two groups, the only difference between the control and treatment groups is the treatment itself, so that its effects can be identified.
Experiments can be replicated: They are designed to be implementable with other groups of participants.
Experimenters attempt to control for other possible explanations: Other variables are kept constant wherever possible, because they may affect the behaviour we want to measure.

This means that when people behave differently in the experiment, it is likely due to differences in their preferences, not in the situation that each person faces.

In our Economist in action video, Juan Camilo Crdenas talks about his innovative use of experimental economics in real-life situations.


Economists have studied public goods extensively using laboratory experiments in which the subjects are asked to make decisions about how much to contribute to a public good. In some cases, economists have designed experiments that closely mimic real-world social dilemmas. The work of Juan Camilo Crdenas, an economist at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot, Colombia is an example. He performs experiments about social dilemmas with people who are facing similar problems in their real life, such as overexploitation of a forest or a fish stock. In our Economist in action video he describes his use of experimental economics in real-life situations, and how it helps us understand why people cooperate even when there are apparent incentives not to do so.
Economists have discovered that the way people behave in experiments can be used to predict how they react in real-life situations. For example, fishermen in Brazil who acted more cooperatively in an experimental game also practiced fishing in a more sustainable manner than the fishermen who were less cooperative in the experiment.
For a summary of the kinds of experiments that have been run, the main results, and whether behaviour in the experimental lab predicts real-life behaviour, read the research done by some of the economists who specialize in experimental economics. For example, Colin Camerer and Ernst Fehr,10 Armin Falk and James Heckman,11 or the experiments done by Joseph Heinrich and a large team of collaborators around the world.12
In Exercise 4.5, however, Stephen Levitt and John List ask whether people would behave the same way in the street as they do in the laboratory.


Question 4.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
According to the Economist in action video of Juan Camilo Crdenas, which of the following have economists discovered using experiments simulating public goods scenarios?

The imposition of external regulation sometimes erodes the willingness of participants to cooperate.
Populations with greater inequality exhibit a greater tendency to cooperate.
Once real cash is used instead of tokens of hypothetical sums of money, people cease to act cooperatively.
People are often willing to cooperate rather than free ride.


This is one of the findings that Professor Crdenas mentions.
Professor Crdenas finds that populations with greater inequality exhibit less trust and cooperation.
Cooperative behaviour occurs even when experimental participants are offered real cash as in Professor Crdenas experiments.
This is one of the findings that Professor Crdenas mentions.



Exercise 4.5 Are lab experiments always valid?
In 2007, Steven Levitt and John List published a paper called What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World?. Read the paper to answer these two questions.

According to their paper,13 why and how might peoples behaviour in real life vary from what has been observed in laboratory experiments?
Using the example of the public goods experiment in this section, explain why you might observe systematic differences between the observations recorded in Figures 4.9a and 4.9b, and what might happen in real life.


Sometimes it is possible to conduct experiments in the field: that is, to deliberately change the economic conditions under which people make decisions, and observe how their behaviour changes. An experiment conducted in Israel in 1998 demonstrated that social preferences may be very sensitive to the context in which decisions are made.
It is common for parents to rush to pick up their children from daycare. Sometimes a few parents are late, making teachers stay extra time. What would you do to deter parents from being late? Two economists ran an experiment introducing fines in some daycare centres but not others (these were used as controls). The price of lateness went from zero to ten Israeli shekels (about $3 at the time). Surprisingly, after the fine was introduced, the frequency of late pickups doubled. The top line in Figure 4.10 illustrates this.

Why did putting a price on lateness backfire?
One possible explanation is that before the fine was introduced, most parents were on time because they felt that it was the right thing to do. In other words, they came on time because of a moral obligation to avoid inconveniencing the daycare staff. Perhaps they felt an altruistic concern for the staff, or regarded a timely pick-up as a reciprocal responsibility in the joint care of the child. But the imposition of the fine signalled that the situation was really more like shopping. Lateness had a price and so could be purchased, like vegetables or ice-cream.14

crowding outThere are two quite distinct uses of the term. One is the observed negative effect when economic incentives displace peoples ethical or other-regarding motivations. In studies of individual behaviour, incentives may have a crowding out effect on social preferences. A second use of the term is to refer to the effect of an increase in government spending in reducing private spending, as would be expected for example in an economy working at full capacity utilization, or when a fiscal expansion is associated with a rise in the interest rate.

The use of a market-like incentivethe price of latenesshad provided what psychologists call a new frame for the decision, making it one in which self-interest rather than concern for others was acceptable. When fines and prices have these unintended effects, we say that incentives have crowded out social preferences. Even worse, you can also see from Figure 4.10 that when the fine was removed, parents continued to pick up their children late.

Question 4.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 4.10 depicts the average number of late-coming parents per week in day-care centres, where a fine was introduced in some centres and not in others. The fines were eventually abolished, as indicated on the graph.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The introduction of the fine successfully reduced the number of late-coming parents.
The fine can be considered as the price for collecting a child.
The graph suggests that the experiment may have permanently increased the parents tendency to be late.
The crowding out of the social preference did not occur until the fines ended.


The graph shows that the number of late-coming parents more than doubled in the centres where the fine was introduced.
The parents paid the fine if they were late and not otherwise. So it can be considered as a price for lateness.
The graph shows that the number of late-coming parents remained high after the fine was abolished, so it is possible that the experiment had a permanent effect.
The crowding out of the social preference occurs when the moral obligation of not being late is replaced by the market-like incentive of purchasing the right to be late without ethical qualms. This is evident in the graph immediately after the introduction of the fines.



Exercise 4.6 Crowding out
Imagine you are the mayor of a small town and wish to motivate your citizens to get involved in City Beautiful Day, in which people spend one day to help cleaning parks and roads.
How would you design the day to motivate citizens to take part?
