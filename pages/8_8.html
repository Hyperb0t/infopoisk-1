8.7 The effects of taxes
Governments can use taxation to raise revenue (to finance government spending, or redistribute resources) or to affect the allocation of goods and services in other ways, perhaps because the government considers a particular good to be harmful. The supply and demand model is a useful tool for analysing the effects of taxation.
Using taxes to raise revenue
Raising revenue through taxation has a long history (see Unit 22). Take the taxation of salt, for example. For most of history, salt was used all over the world as a preservative, allowing food to be stored, transported, and traded. The ancient Chinese advocated taxing salt, since people needed it, however high the price. Salt taxes were an effective but often resented tool used by ruling elites in ancient India and medieval kings. Resentment of high salt taxes played an important part in the French Revolution, and Gandhi led protests against the salt tax imposed by the British in India.
Figure 8.14 illustrates how a salt tax might work. Initially the market equilibrium is at point A: the price is P* and the quantity of salt traded is Q*. Suppose that a sales tax of 30% is imposed on the price of salt, to be paid to the government by the suppliers. If suppliers have to pay a 30% tax, their marginal cost of supplying each unit of salt increases by 30%. So the supply curve shifts: the price is 30% higher at each quantity.

The initial equilibrium


Initially the market equilibrium is at point A. The price is P* and the quantity of salt sold is Q*.














A 30% tax


A 30% tax is imposed on suppliers. Their marginal costs are effectively 30% higher at each quantity. The supply curve shifts.














The new equilibrium


The new equilibrium is at B. The price paid by consumers has risen to P1 and the quantity has fallen to Q1.














The tax paid to the government


The price received by suppliers (after they have paid the tax) is P0. The double-headed arrow shows the tax paid to the government on each unit of salt sold.




The new equilibrium is at point B, where a lower quantity of salt is traded. Although the consumer price has risen, note that it is not 30% higher than before. The price paid by consumers, P1, is 30% higher than the price received by the suppliers (net of the tax), which is P0. Suppliers receive a lower price than before, they produce less, and their profits will be lower. This illustrates an important feature of taxes: it is not necessarily the taxpayer who feels its main effect. In this case, although the suppliers pay the tax, the tax incidence falls partly on consumers and partly on producers.

Figure 8.15 shows the effect of the tax on consumer and producer surplus:

Consumer surplus falls: Consumers pay a higher price, and buy less salt.
Producer surplus falls: They produce less and receive a lower net price.
Total surplus is lower: Even taking account of the tax revenue received by the government, the tax causes a deadweight loss.



















Taxation and deadweight loss.

Maximized gains from trade


Before the tax is imposed, the equilibrium allocation at A maximizes the gains from trade. In the upper panel the red triangle is the consumer surplus and the blue triangle is the producer surplus.














A tax reduces consumer surplus


The tax reduces the quantity traded to Q1, and raises the consumer price from P* to P1. The consumer surplus falls.














A tax reduces producer surplus


The suppliers sell a lower quantity, and the price they receive falls from P* to P0. The producer surplus falls.














The tax revenue and deadweight loss


A tax equal to (P1  P0) is paid on each of the Q1 units of salt that are sold. The green rectangular area is the total tax revenue. There is a deadweight loss equal to the area of the white triangle.




When the salt tax is imposed, the total surplus from trade in the salt market is given by:

Since the quantity of salt traded is no longer at the level that maximizes gains from trade, the tax has led to a deadweight loss.
In general, taxes change prices, and prices change buyers and sellers decisions, which can cause deadweight loss. To raise as much revenue as possible, the government would prefer to tax a good for which demand is not very responsive to price, so that the fall in quantity traded is quite smallthat is to say, a good with a low elasticity of demand. That is why the ancient Chinese recommended taxing salt.
We can think of the total surplus as a measure of the welfare of society as a whole (provided that the tax revenue is used for the benefit of society). So there is a second reason for a government that cares about welfare to prefer taxing goods with low elasticity of demandthe loss of total surplus will be lower. The overall effect of the tax depends on what the government does with the revenues that it collects:

The government spends the revenue on goods and services that enhance the wellbeing of the population: Then the tax and resulting expenditure may enhance public welfareeven though it reduces the surplus in the particular market that is taxed.
The government spends the revenues on an activity that does not contribute to wellbeing: Then the lost consumer surplus is just a reduction in the living standards of the population.

Therefore, taxes can improve or reduce overall welfare. The most that we can say is that taxing a good whose demand is inelastic is an efficient way to transfer the surplus from consumers to the government.
The governments power to levy taxes is a bit like the price-setting power of a firm that sells a differentiated good. It uses its power to raise the price and collect revenue, while reducing the quantity sold. Its ability to levy taxes depends on the institutions it can use to enforce and collect them.
One reason for the use of salt taxes in earlier times was that it was relatively easy for a powerful ruler to take full control of salt production, in some cases as a monopolist. In the notorious case of the French salt tax, the monarchy not only controlled all salt production; it also forced its subjects to buy up to 7 kg of salt each per year.
In March and April 1930, the artificially high price of salt in British colonial India provoked one of the defining moments of the Indian independence movement: Mahatma Gandhis salt march to acquire salt from the Indian ocean. Similarly, in what came to be called the Boston tea party, in 1773 American colonists objecting to a British colonial tax on tea dumped a cargo of tea into the Boston harbour.
Resistance to taxes on inelastic goods arises for the very reason they are imposed: they are difficult to escape!
In many modern economies the institutions for tax collection are well-established, usually with democratic consent. Provided that citizens believe taxes have been implemented fairly, using them to raise revenue is accepted as a necessary part of social and economic policy. We will now look at another reason why governments may decide to levy taxes.
Using taxes to change behaviour
Policymakers in many countries are interested in the idea of using taxes to deter consumption of unhealthy foods with the objective of improving public health and tackling the obesity epidemic. In Unit 7, we looked at some data and estimates of demand elasticities for food products in the US, which help to predict how higher prices might affect peoples diets there. Some countries have already introduced food taxes. Several, including France, Norway, Mexico, Samoa, and Fiji, tax sweetened drinks. Hungarys chips tax is aimed at products carrying proven health risks, particularly those with high sugar or salt content. In 2011, the Danish government introduced a tax on products with high saturated fat content.7
The level of the Danish tax was 16 Danish kroner (kr) per kilogram of saturated fat, corresponding to 10.4 kr per kg of butter. Note that this was a specific tax, levied as a fixed amount per unit of butter. A tax like the one we analysed for salt, levied as a percentage of the price, is known as an ad valorem tax. According to a study of the Danish fat tax, it corresponded to about 22% of the average butter price in the year before the tax. The study found that it reduced the consumption of butter and related products (butter blends, margarine, and oil) by between 15% and 20%. We can illustrate the effects in the same way as we did for the salt tax, using the supply and demand model (we are assuming here that butter retailers are price-takers).
Figure 8.16 shows a demand curve for butter, measured in kilograms per person per year. The numbers correspond approximately to Denmarks experience. We have drawn the supply curve for butter as almost flat, on the assumption that the marginal cost of butter for retailers does not change very much as quantity varies. The initial equilibrium is at point A, where the price of butter is 45 kr per kg, and each person consumes 2 kg of butter per year.

Equilibrium in the market for butter


Initially the market for butter is in equilibrium. The price of butter is 45 kr per kg, and consumption of butter in Denmark is 2 kg per person per year.














The effect of a tax


A tax of 10 kr per kg levied on suppliers raises their marginal costs by 10 kr at every quantity. The supply curve shifts upwards by 10 kr.














A new equilibrium


The new equilibrium is at point B. The price has risen to 54 kr. Each persons annual consumption of butter has fallen to 1.6 kg.




A tax of 10 kr per kg shifts the supply curve upwards and leads to a rise in price to 54 kr, and a fall in consumption to 1.6 kg. The consumer price rises by 9 kralmost the full amount of the taxand the suppliers net revenue per kg of butter falls to 44 kr. In this case, although suppliers pay the tax, the tax incidence is felt mainly by consumers. Of the 10 kr tax per kg, the consumer effectively pays 9 kr, while the supplier or producer pays 1 kr. So the price received by the retailers, net of tax, is only 1 kr lower.
Figure 8.17 shows what happens to consumer and producer surplus as a result of the fat tax.











The effect of a fat tax on the consumer and producer surplus for butter.


Figure 8.17 
The effect of a fat tax on the consumer and producer surplus for butter.
        




Again, both consumer and producer surpluses fall. The area of the green rectangle represents the tax revenue: with a tax of 10 kr per kg and equilibrium sales of 1.6 kg per person, tax revenue is 10  1.6 = 16 kr per person per year.
How effective was the fat tax policy? For a full evaluation of the effect on health we should look at all the foods taxed, and take into account the cross-price effectsthe changes in consumption of other foods caused by the tax. The study of the Danish tax also allowed for the possibility that some retailers are not price-takers. Nevertheless, Figures 8.16 and 8.17 illustrate some important implications of the tax:

Consumption of butter products fell: In this case by 20%. You can see this in Figure 8.16. In this respect, the policy was successful.
There was a large fall in surplus, especially consumer surplus: You can see this in Figure 8.17. But recall that the governments aim when it implemented the fat tax policy was not to raise revenue, but rather to reduce quantity. So the fall in consumer surplus was inevitable. The loss of surplus caused by a tax is a deadweight loss, which sounds negative. But in this case the policymaker might see it as a gain if the good, butter, is considered bad for consumers.

One aspect of taxation not illustrated in our supply and demand analysis is the cost of collecting it. Although the Danish fat tax successfully reduced fat consumption, the government abolished it after only 15 months because of the administrative burden it placed on firms. Any taxation system requires effective mechanisms for tax collection, and designing taxes that are simple to administer (and difficult to avoid) is an important goal of tax policy. Policymakers who want to introduce food taxes will need to find ways of minimizing administrative costs. But since the costs cannot be eliminated, they will also need to consider whether the health gain (and reduction of costs of bad health) will be sufficient to offset them.

Exercise 8.7 The deadweight loss of the butter tax
Food taxes such as the ones discussed here and in Unit 7 are often intended to shift consumption towards a healthier diet, but give rise to deadweight loss.
Why do you think a policymaker and a consumer might interpret this deadweight loss differently?


Question 8.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 8.14 shows the demand and supply curves for salt, and the shift in the supply curve due to the implementation of a 30% tax on the price of salt. Which of the following statements are correct?

In the post-tax equilibrium, the consumers pay P1 and the producers receive P*.
The governments tax revenue is given by (P*  P0)Q1.
The deadweight loss is given by (1/2)(P1  P0)(Q*  Q1).
As a result of the tax, the consumer surplus is reduced by (1/2)(Q1 + Q*)(P1  P*).


In the post-tax equilibrium, the consumers pay P1 and the producers receive P0.
The governments tax revenue is (P1  P0)  Q1.
This is the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves, below AB.
This is the area of the trapezium between the horizontal dotted lines through A and B.



Question 8.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 8.17 shows the effect of a tax intended to reduce the consumption of butter. The before-tax equilibrium is at A = (2.0 kg, 45 kr) and the after-tax equilibrium is at B = (1.6 kg, 54 kr). The tax imposed is 10 kr per kg of butter. Which of the following statements is correct?

The producers receive 45 kr per kg of butter.
The tax policy would be more effective if the supply curve were less elastic.
The very elastic supply curve implies that the incidence of the tax falls mainly on consumers.
The loss of consumer surplus due to tax is (1/2)  10  (2.0  1.6) = 2.0.


The producers receive the price 54  10 = 44 kr per kg.
If the supply curve were less elastic, the policy would be less effectivebutter consumption would not fall as much.
The elastic supply curve means that the price paid by consumers changes much more than the price received by producers.
The calculation gives the deadweight loss, not the loss of consumer surplus.
