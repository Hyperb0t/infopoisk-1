22.11 A puzzle: The persistence of unfairness and market failures in democracies
Contemporary South Africa is just one example of a society in which there are opportunities for mutual gain that are not exploitedfor example, More than one-quarter of the labour force are unemployed. And it is widely heldeven by many well-off South Africansthat the distribution of the economys burdens and benefits is still grossly unfair.
The previous units have shown similar cases in which economic outcomes are Pareto inefficient, so potential mutual gains remain unrealized, as the summary table in Figure 12.8 showed. Figure 22.3 listed policies aimed at addressing inefficiency and perceived unfairness. And we know that citizens in many countries think the distribution of wealth or income is unfair.
This is a puzzle. If government action could realize potential gains, and the citizens in a democracy would prefer that it did, why do these inefficiencies persist in a democratic society with a capitalist economy? The short answer is that just as markets fail, so too do governments.
Government failure
Fixing some problem of Pareto inefficiency or perceived unfairness will happen only if:

It is economically feasible: The policy to fix the problem, if implemented, must work.
It is administratively feasible: The government must have the capacity to implement the policy.
Special interests allow it: Those who control government policy must want to see the policy implemented.

Economic infeasibility

economically feasiblePolicies for which the desired outcomes are a Nash equilibrium, so that once implemented private economic actors will not undo the desired effects.

Given peoples preferences and the information available to private economic actors, there may not be a feasible set of policies that would sustain an efficient and fair outcome. For a policy to have economic feasibility, it must be a Nash equilibrium, which means no actor can improve its position by changing its behaviour.
For example, a government that tried to enforce perfect competition in every industry would fail. Since firms are free to advertise, and to differentiate their products, it is impossible for the policymaker to legislate that demand curves be horizontal. We have also seen that no macroeconomic policy can entirely eliminate unemployment, given that the threat of unemployment motivates people to work hard and well.
Administrative infeasibility

administratively feasiblePolicies for which the government has sufficient information and staff for implementation.

Even if there is an economically feasible policy that would address a problem if it were adopted and implemented, this may be impossible in practice due to the limited information and capabilities of government officials, which means it lacks administrative feasibility. By failing to understand the incentives of the relevant economic actors or other aspects of the problem, policies adopted by the government may be ill-suited to the objectives of all the actors. So governments may lack the capacity to collect tax revenue efficiently and honestly, to enforce its policies through the judiciary (including anti-monopoly policy), and to deliver public services such as schooling and health.
Special interests
Even if a policy is economically feasible (a Nash equilibrium) and could be implemented administratively, the government may choose not to adopt it because of opposition by groups (including members of the government itself) that would be harmed by the change, which would be the case if certain groups benefit from the unfairness or the inefficiency.
In the next three sections, we will consider in turn how economic infeasibility, administrative infeasibility, and special interests can prevent fair and efficient policies from being introduced.
