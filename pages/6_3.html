6.2 Other peoples money: The separation of ownership and control
The firms profits legally belong to the people who own the firms assets, which include its capital goods. The owners direct the other members of the firm to take actions that contribute to the firms profits. This in turn will increase the value of the firms assets, and improve the wealth of the owners.

residual claimantThe person who receives the income left over from a firm or other project after the payment of all contractual costs (for example the cost of hiring workers and paying taxes).

The owners take whatever remains after revenues (the proceeds from sale of the products) are used to pay employees, managers, suppliers, creditors, and taxes. Profit is the residual. It is whats left of the revenues after these payments. The owners claim it, which is why they are called residual claimants. Managers (unless they are also owners) are not residual claimants. Neither are employees.
This division of revenue has an important implication. If the firms revenues increase because managers or employees do their job well, the owners will benefit, but the managers and employees will not (unless they receive a promotion, bonus, or salary increase). This is one reason we consider the firm as a stage, one on which not all the actors have the same interests.
In small enterprises, the owners are typically also the managers and so are in charge of operational and strategic decisions. As an example, consider a restaurant owned by a sole proprietor, who decides on the menu, hours of operation, marketing strategies, choice of suppliers, and the size and compensation of the workforce. In most cases the owner will try to maximize the profits of the enterprise by providing the kinds of food and ambience that people want, at competitive prices. Unlike Apple, the owner cannot outsource dishwashing or table service to a low-wage location.

shareA part of the assets of a firm that may be traded. It gives the holder a right to receive a proportion of a firms profit and to benefit when the firms assets become more valuable. Also known as: common stock.

In large corporations, there are typically many owners. Most of them play no part in the firms management. The owners of the firm are the individuals and institutions, such as pension funds, that own the shares issued by the firm. By issuing shares to the general public, a company can raise capital to finance its growth, leaving strategic and operational decisions to a relatively small group of specialized managers.
These decisions include what, where, and how to manufacture the firms products, or how much to pay employees and managers. The senior management of a firm is also responsible for deciding how much of the firms profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, and how much is retained to finance growth. Of course, the owners benefit from the firms growth because they own part of the value of the firm, which increases as the firm grows.

separation of ownership and controlThe attribute of some firms by which managers are a separate group from the owners.

When managers decide on the use of other peoples funds, this is referred to as the separation of ownership and control.
The separation of ownership and control results in a potential conflict of interest.
The decisions of managers affect profits, and profits decide the incomes of the owners. But it is not always in the interest of managers to maximize profits. They may choose to take actions that benefit themselves, at the expense of the owners. Perhaps they will spend as much as possible on their company credit card, or seek to increase their own power and prestige through empire-building, even if that is not in the interests of shareholders.
Even single owners of firms are not required to maximize their profits. Restaurant owners can choose menus they personally like, or waiters who are their friends. But unlike managers, when they lose profits as a result, the cost comes directly out of their pocket.
In the eighteenth century, Adam Smith observed the tendency of senior managers to serve their own interests, rather than those of shareholders. He said this about the managers of what were then called joint-stock companies:

[B]eing the managers rather of other peoples money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a [firm managed by its owners] frequently watch over their own Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company. (The Wealth of Nations, 1776)


free rideBenefiting from the contributions of others to some cooperative project without contributing oneself.

Smith had not seen the modern firm, but he understood the problems raised by the separation of ownership and control. There are two ways that owners can incentivize managers to serve their interests. They can structure contracts so that managerial compensation depends on the performance of the companys share price. Also, the firms board of directors, which represents the firms shareholders and typically has a substantial share in the firm (like a representative of a pension fund), can monitor the managers performance. The board has the authority to dismiss managers, and shareholders in turn have the right to replace members of the board. The owners of large companies with many shareholders rarely exercise this authority, partly because shareholders are a large and diverse group that cannot easily get together to decide something. Occasionally, however, this free-rider problem is overcome and a shareholder with a large stake in a company may lead a shareholder revolt to change or influence senior management.
When we model the firm as an actor, we often assume that it maximizes profits. This is a simplification, but a reasonable one for most purposes:

Owners have a strong interest in profit maximization: It is the basis of their wealth.
Market competition penalizes or eliminates firms that do not make substantial profits for their owners: We saw this process in Unit 1 and Unit 2 as part of the explanation of the permanent technological revolution, and it applies to all aspects of the firms decisions.


Question 6.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements about the separation of ownership and control is true?

When the ownership and control of a firm is separated, the managers become the residual claimants.
Managers always work to maximize the firms profit.
One way to address the problem associated with the separation of ownership and control is to pay the managers a salary that depends on the performance of the firms share price.
It is effective for shareholders to monitor the performance of the management, in a firm owned by a large number of shareholders.


The shareholders are the residual claimants.
Managers may choose to take actions that provide benefits for themselves at the expense of the owners.
Such performance-related pay is a common method of incentivizing managers to maximize the value of their firm.
When there are many shareholders, there is not only a coordination problem but also a free-rider problem, where every shareholder relies on others to do the costly monitoring (and hence no monitoring is undertaken as a result).
