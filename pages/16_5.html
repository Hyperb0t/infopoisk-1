16.4 Investment, firm entry, and the price-setting curve in the long run
In Figure 16.1 we saw the remarkable divergence in unemployment rates across advanced economies that began in the 1970s. In the most recent period shown on the chart, European countries like Spain, Greece, or France experienced very high unemployment rates, ranging from around 10% in France to more than 20% in Spain, while in other countries, especially those in East Asia (South Korea, Japan) and in northern Europe (Austria, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany), unemployment was between 5% and 6%.
To explain the main trends over time and differences in the unemployment rate among countries, we extend concepts from earlier units to model the long run. In this long-run model, things that may change slowly and which are assumed to be constant in medium- or short-run modelssuch as the size of the capital stock, and the firms operating in the economycan fully adjust to a change in economic conditions.
Determinants of economic performance in the long run
In the long run, the unemployment rate will depend on how well a countrys policies and institutions address the two big incentive problems of a capitalist economy:

expropriation riskThe probability that an asset will be taken from its owner by the government or some other actor.


Work incentives: Wage and salary workers must work hard and well, even though it is difficult to design and enforce contracts that accomplish this (as we saw in Unit 6).
Investment incentives: The owners of firms must invest in job creation when they could invest abroad, or simply use their profits to buy consumption goods and not invest at all. As we saw in Unit 14, firms considering investment decisions will take account not only of the rate of profit after taxes, but also the risk of adverse changes such as hostile legislation or even confiscation of their property, which is referred to as expropriation risk. Just as workers cannot be forced to work hard but have to be motivated to do so, firms cannot be forced to create new jobs or to maintain existing ones.

Solving both problems simultaneously would mean a low level of unemployment at the same time as rapidly rising wages. But ways of addressing one of these problems may make it difficult to address the other. For example, policies that lead to very high wages may induce employees to work hard, but leave owners of firms with little incentive to invest in creating new productive capacity and jobs.8
In the next section we will see that countries differ in how successfully they address these two incentive problems simultaneously.

wage-setting curveThe curve that gives the real wage necessary at each level of economy-wide employment to provide workers with incentives to work hard and well.

The wage-setting curve that we have used in Units 6, 9, 14, and 15 shows that wages must be higher when unemployed workers expect to find a new job easily or when they receive a generous unemployment benefit, both of which reduce the expected cost of job loss. This is why the wage-setting curve is positively related to the employment level, and why an increase in the unemployment benefit will shift the curve upward, as this research demonstrates.

price-setting curveThe curve that gives the real wage paid when firms choose their profit-maximizing price.

The necessary incentives for investment by owners of firms are represented by the price-setting curve in the labour market model (see Unit 9).
We will extend the labour market model to the long run by allowing firms to enter and exit, and owners to expand the capital stock or allow it to shrink. To simplify, lets assume that firms are all of a given size, and that the capital stock grows or shrinks simply by the addition or subtraction of firms. We assume that there are constant returns to scale so that in the long run, percentage increases in employment are matched by the same percentage increase in capital.
We define the long-run equilibrium in the labour market as a situation in which not only real wages and the employment level, but also the number of firms, is constant (remember that equilibrium is always defined by what is unchanging, unless there is some force for change from things not considered in the model).
There are two conditions that determine how the number of firms may change:

Firm exit due to a low markup: Owners may withdraw their funds or even close firms if the existing markup is too low, meaning that the expected rate of profit after taxes is not attractive relative to the alternative uses to which the owners could put their assets. These alternative uses could be investing in foreign subsidiaries, outsourcing part of the production process, buying government bonds, or distributing its profits as dividends to the owners. In this case, the number of firms falls.
Firm entry due to a high markup: If the markup is sufficiently high, the resulting high profit rate will attract new firms to enter the economy.

When is firm exit due to too low a markup likely to happen? This will occur when the economy is highly competitive as a result of a great number of competing firms, resulting in a high elasticity of demand for the firms products and hence a small markup. When there are too many firms to sustain a high enough markup, then firms will exit, which will tend to raise the markup.
Similarly, when there are few firms in the economy, the degree of competition will be limited, the markup will be high, and the resulting profit rate will be sufficient to attract new firms to enter. As a result, the economy will become more competitive and the markup will fall.
This means that the markup has a tendency to self-correct. If it is too low then firms will exit and it will rise, and if it is too high then firms will enter and it will decline.
Figure 16.7a illustrates this process by showing how the number of firms and the profit-maximizing markup are related. For each number of firms, the downward-sloping line gives the markup that maximizes the firms profits. It slopes downward because:

The more firms there are, the more competitive the economy is.
This means a higher elasticity of demand facing the firms when they sell their products (less steep demand curves).
The markup that maximizes the firms profits will fall, because, as we saw in Unit 7, the markup, , is 1/(elasticity of demand).

The other line in the figure is horizontal and shows the markup that is just sufficient to retain the existing number of firms, which we call *. Follow the steps in the analysis in Figure 16.7a to see why the number of firms will be stable at 210.

Firm entry, exit, and the equilibrium markup.
        















The profit-maximizing markup


The downward sloping line gives the markup that maximizes the firms profits, for a given number of firms. The number of firms is constant and equal to 210 at the equilibrium markup, *.














Competition and number of firms


The more firms there are, the more competitive the economy, which will result in a higher elasticity of demand and a lower markup.














Firm exit


With 250 firms, the markup is below * and firms will leave the economy.














Firm entry


With 190 firms, the economy is at B and the markup exceeds *, so new firms will enter.




Now, using Figure 16.7a, think what would occur if as a result of a change of government, the risk of expropriation of private property by the government decreased. This is an improvement in the conditions for operating a business, and could include changes in legislation that reduce the probability that the government will take over firms or implement unpredictable changes in taxation. With better business conditions, a lower markup is required for firms to operate in this economy. Follow the steps in Figure 16.7b to see how this leads to an increase in the number of firms in equilibrium.

This lowers the equilibrium markup. The existing markup at A is now too high.














New firms enter the market


The economy grows until there are 250 firms.




From the equilibrium markup to the price-setting curve in the long run
As before, once we know the markup * and the average product of labour , we know the real wage w that must result: it is the share of the average product of labour (or, equivalently, of output per worker) that is not claimed by the employer through the markup. With constant returns to scale, if capital per worker remains constant, higher employment is consistent with constant output per worker: the long-run price-setting curve is flat. We note as well that in the model, the unemployed and employed workers are identical because of the presence of involuntary unemployment in the labour market equilibrium.
The long-run price-setting curve is given by:

As Figure 16.8 shows, this fact allows us to translate the equilibrium markup into the real wage paid, which fixes the height of the price-setting curve. In the left-hand panel, the equation of the long-run price-setting curve is drawn as a horizontal line, with the equilibrium markup on the horizontal axis and the wage on the vertical axis: with a zero markup, the wage is equal to output per worker; and when the markup is equal to 1 (or equivalently 100%), the wage is equal to zero.
The right-hand panel of Figure 16.8 shows the long-run price-setting curve at different levels of the long-run equilibrium markup. By employment on the horizontal axis in the long-run model, we mean employment with constant capital per worker. We can summarize the factors that will shift the long-run price-setting curve through their effects on either output per worker or the markup.
The long-run price-setting curve is higher:

the higher the output per worker
the lower the long-run markup at which firm entry and exit are zero













Figure 16.8 
Changes in the long-run markup shift the price-setting curve.
        















The-long run price-setting curve


In the left-hand panel, the equation of the long-run price-setting curve is shown as a downward-sloping line in the diagram, with the equilibrium markup on the horizontal axis and the wage on the vertical axis.














A low markup


A low long-run equilibrium markup is associated with a higher long-run price-setting curve.














A high markup


Long-run price-setting curves are lower for higher markups.





The long-run price-setting curve
Once we know the equilibrium markup * and the productivity of labour , we know the real wage w is given by:

w is the output per worker that is not claimed by the employer through the markup.

What lowers the markup at which entry and exit are zero?

higher competition
lower risk of expropriation of owners in the home economy
higher quality environment for doing business: for example, better human capital or infrastructure
lower expected long-run tax rate
lower opportunity cost of capital: for example, a lower interest rate on bonds
lower expected profits on foreign investments
lower expected long-term cost of imported materials


Exercise 16.4 Measuring the conditions for investment
Go to the World Banks Doing Business database.

In the Topics section, collect (download) data on three characteristics of the business environment that will affect the long-run markup, for 20 countries of your choice. Justify your choice of characteristics.

Now go to the World Banks DataBank database.

Download GDP per capita data for the 20 countries of your choice. For each characteristic, create a scatterplot with the characteristic of the business environment (rank) on the horizontal axis, and GDP per capita on the vertical axis. Summarize the relationship between the two variables (if any).
Explain why a good business environment may raise GDP per capita.
Why might high GDP per capita improve the business environment?
From your answers to questions 3 and 4, explain the potential challenges when interpreting the relationship between two variables using a scatterplot.



Question 16.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 16.8 depicts the graphs of the long-run price-setting curve and the markup at which firm entry and exit are both zero.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

An increase in the degree of competition in the economy will lower the price-setting curve.
A lower interest rate leads to a lower price-setting curve.
Lower worker productivity leads to a higher price-setting curve for a given markup *.
Higher risk of expropriation of businesses overseas results in a higher price-setting curve.


An increase in the degree of competition will lower the markup and raise the price-setting curve.
A lower interest rate means lower opportunity cost of capital. Therefore the profit rate at which firm entry and exit are zero is lower, meaning that the corresponding wage rate (shown by the price-setting curve) is higher.
Lower worker productivity () causes the real wage-setting curve on the left-hand graph to rotate downwards (pivoted at * = 1 on the horizontal axis). This shifts the price-setting curves down for a given *.
This will lower the expected return on investments abroad, lowering equilibrium profits at home and therefore lowering the markup. This leads to a higher price-setting curve.



Question 16.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding the model of the labour market?

In the short- and medium-run models the amount of capital is fixed, while in the long-run model the amount of capital can vary.
Labour-saving technological progress raises unemployment in both the short and long run.
In the long-run model, firms enter the market when the markup is low.
In the long-run model, the markup is independent of the number of firms.


This is how we define the long run.
At a given capital stock, labour-saving technological progress raises unemployment, but as the capital stock expands with new firm entry, unemployment falls, and may be lower than initially.
Firms enter when the markup is high, which means a higher profit rate.
The markup self-corrects as the firms enter and exit: a high markup leads to more firms entering, resulting in a fall in the markup, while a low markup leads to firms exiting, resulting in an increase in the markup.
