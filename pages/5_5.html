5.4 A model of choice and conflict
In the remainder of this unit we explore some economic interactions and evaluate the resulting allocations. As in the experiments in Unit 4, we will see that both cooperation and conflict occur. As in the experiments, and in history, we will find that the rules matter.
Recall the model in Unit 3 of the farmer, Angela, who produces a crop. We will develop the model into a sequence of scenarios involving two characters:

Initially, Angela works the land on her own, and gets everything she produces.
Next, we introduce a second person, who does not farm, but would also like some of the harvest. He is called Bruno.
At first, Bruno can force Angela to work for him. In order to survive, she has to do what he says.
Later, the rules change: the rule of law replaces the rule of force. Bruno can no longer coerce Angela to work. But he owns the land and if she wants to farm his land, she must agree, for example, to pay him some part of the harvest.
Eventually, the rules of the game change again in Angelas favour. She and her fellow farmers achieve the right to vote and legislation is passed that increases Angelas claim on the harvest.

For each of these steps we will analyse the changes in terms of both Pareto efficiency and the distribution of income between Angela and Bruno. Remember that:

We can determine objectively whether an outcome is Pareto efficient or not.
But whether the outcome is fair depends on your own analysis of the problem, using the concepts of substantive and procedural fairness.


marginal rate of transformation (MRT)The quantity of some good that must be sacrificed to acquire one additional unit of another good. At any point, it is the slope of the feasible frontier. See also: marginal rate of substitution.

As before, Angelas harvest depends on her hours of work, through the production function. She works the land, and enjoys the remainder of the day as free time. In Unit 3 she consumed the grain that this activity produced. Recall that the slope of the feasible frontier is the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) of free time into grain.

marginal rate of substitution (MRS)The trade-off that a person is willing to make between two goods. At any point, this is the slope of the indifference curve. See also: marginal rate of transformation.

Angela values both grain and free time. Again, we represent her preferences as indifference curves, showing the combinations of grain and free time that she values equally. Remember that the slope of the indifference curve is called the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between grain and free time.
Angela works the land on her own
Figure 5.2 shows Angelas indifference curves and her feasible frontier. The steeper the indifference curve, the more Angela values free time relative to grain. You can see that the more free time she has (moving to the right), the flatter the curvesshe values free time less.
In this unit, we make a particular assumption (called quasi-linearity) about Angelas preferences that you can see in the shape of her indifference curves. As she gets more grain, her MRS does not change. So the curves have the same slope as you move up the vertical line at 16 hours of free time. More grain does not change her valuation of free time relative to grain.
Why might this be? Perhaps she does not eat it all, but sells some and uses the proceeds to buy other things she needs. This is just a simplification (called quasi-linearity) that makes our model easier to understand. Remember: when drawing indifference curves for the model in this unit, simply shift them up and down, keeping the MRS constant at a given amount of free time.
Leibniz: Quasi-linear preferences
Angela is free to choose her typical hours of work to achieve her preferred combination of free time and grain. Work through Figure 5.2 to determine the allocation.

The feasible frontier


The diagram shows Angelas feasible frontier, determined by her production function.














The best Angela can do


The best Angela can do, given the limits set by the feasible frontier, is to work for 8 hours, taking 16 hours of free time and producing 9 bushels of grain. At this point C, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation (MRT).














MRS = MRT


The MRS is the slope of the indifference curve. The trade-off she is willing to make between grain and free time. The MRT is the slope of the feasible frontier: the trade-off she is constrained to make. At point C, the two trade-offs balance.




Figure 5.2 shows that the best Angela can do, given the limits set by the feasible frontier, is to work for 8 hours. She has 16 hours of free time, and produces and consumes 9 bushels of grain. This is the number of hours of work where the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the marginal rate of transformation. She cannot do better than this! (If youre not sure why, go back to Unit 3 and check.)
Leibniz: Angelas choice of working hours
A new character appears
But now, Angela has company. The other person is called Bruno; he is not a farmer but will claim some of Angelas harvest. We will study different rules of the game that explain how much is produced by Angela, and how it is divided between her and Bruno. For example, in one scenario, Bruno is the landowner and Angela pays some grain to him as rent for the use of the land.
Figure 5.3 shows Angela and Brunos combined feasible frontier. The frontier indicates how many bushels of grain Angela can produce given how much free time she takes. For example, if she takes 12 hours free time and works for 12 hours, then she produces 10.5 bushels of grain. One possible outcome of the interaction between Angela and Bruno is that 5.25 bushels go to Bruno, and Angela retains the other 5.25 bushels for her own consumption.
Work through Figure 5.3 to find out how each possible allocation is represented in the diagram, showing how much work Angela did and how much grain she and Bruno each got.












Feasible outcomes of the interaction between Angela and Bruno.

The combined feasible frontier


The feasible frontier shows the maximum amount of grain available to Angela and Bruno together, given Angelas amount of free time. If Angela takes 12 hours of free time and works for 12 hours then she produces 10.5 bushels of grain.














A feasible allocation


Point E is a possible outcome of the interaction between Angela and Bruno.














The distribution at point E


At point E, Angela works for 12 hours and produces 10.5 bushels of grain. The distribution of grain is such that 5.25 bushels go to Bruno and Angela retains the other 5.25 bushels for her own consumption.














Other feasible allocations


Point F shows an allocation in which Angela works more than at point E and gets less grain, and point G shows the case in which she works more and gets more grain.














An impossible allocation


An outcome at Hin which Angela works 12 hours a day, Bruno consumes the entire amount produced and Angela consumes nothingwould not be possible: she would starve.




Which allocations are likely to occur? Not all of them are even possible. For example, at point H Angela works 12 hours a day and receives nothing (Bruno takes the entire harvest), so Angela would not survive. Of the allocations that are at least possible, the one that will occur depends on the rules of the game.

Exercise 5.4 Using indifference curves
In Figure 5.3, point F shows an allocation in which Angela works more and gets less than at point E, and point G shows the case in which she works more and gets more.
By sketching Angelas indifference curves, work out what you can say about her preferences between E, F and G, and how this depends on the slope of the curves.


Question 5.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.3 shows Angela and Brunos combined feasible set, and four allocations that might result from an interaction between them.
From the figure, we can conclude that:

If Angela has very flat indifference curves, she may prefer G to the other three allocations.
If Angela has very steep indifference curves, she may prefer F to the other three allocations.
Allocation G is the best of the four for Bruno.
It is possible that Angela is indifferent between G and E.


Angelas indifference curves are downward-sloping. If the indifference curve through G was sufficiently flat, the other three points would all lie below it.
Whatever the slope of her indifference curves, Angela would prefer E to F, as it gives her more grain and more free time.
Bruno gets an amount of grain equal to the vertical distance from the allocation to the feasible frontier. So G is the worst of the four allocations for him.
Angela could be indifferent between G and Eone of her indifference curves could pass through both points.
