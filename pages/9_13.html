9.12 Looking backward: Baristas and bread markets
We have devoted an entire unit to the labour market for two reasons:

Its functioning is very important for how well the economy serves the interests of the population.
It is different enough from the way that many familiar markets work that it is essential to know these differences to understand how the economy works.

A good way to review these differences is to contrast the market for bread that we used to illustrate the model of a competitive equilibrium of price takers in the previous unit with the market for, say, baristas (which, for readers unfamiliar with Italian-inspired coffee shops, are those who make espresso-based coffee drinks).
Taking a price, setting a price
Recall that in the equilibrium of the bread market, neither bread consumers nor bakeries selling bread could benefit by offering to pay a different price or setting a different price from the one that prevailed in other transactions throughout the market. Buyers and sellers were price-takers in equilibrium:

No buyer could benefit from offering to pay less than the prevailing price: No bakery would agree to the sale.
No buyer could benefit by offering to pay more than the going price: This would just be throwing away money. Buyers in the bread market are price-takers because they wish to purchase bread at the lowest possible price.
No seller (a bakery) could benefit from setting a higher price: There would be no customers.
No seller could benefit by offering a lower price: This would be throwing away money. They can have as many customers as they like at the existing price.


reservation wageWhat an employee would get in alternative employment, or from an unemployment benefit or other support, were he or she not employed in his or her current job.

Now think about a buyer in the labour market. This is an employer who buys the employees time. The price is the wage. An employer who acts like a bread-buyer would offer the employee the lowest wage that the individual would accept to take the job. This lowest possible wage is the reservation wage.
We know from Unit 6 that an employer who did this would be disappointed. The worker who is paid just a reservation wage does not worry about losing the job, and so would have little incentive to work hard for the employer. Instead, we saw that employers choose a wage to balance their wage costs against the positive effects that a higher wage has on the employees motivation to work.
Complete and incomplete contracts
In the bread market, the sales contract between buyer and seller is for bread, and if you buy bread you get what you want. Its a complete contract (remember, a contract need not be in writing and it need not be signed to be enforceable: your receipt is enough to get a refund if the bag labelled fresh bread turned out to contain a week-old loaf when you got home).

incomplete contractA contract that does not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of parties to the exchange (or of others).

In contrast, in the labour market, the employment contract is usually for the employees work time and not for the work itself. Because it is the employees work that produces the firms goods and is essential to the firms profits, this means the contract is an incomplete contract: something that matters to one of the parties to the exchange is not covered in the contract.
The implication is that, in contrast to the bread market, for a buyer in the labour market, paying more than is necessary to buy the employees time is not throwing away money; it is the way that employers get what they want (work) and how they make profits. And because they are deciding on the price (that is, the wage) that they will offer the worker, they are price-setters and not price-takers. This is why Unit 8s model of the competitive equilibrium of price-takers does not work in the labour market.
Pareto efficiency and unexploited opportunities for mutual gains
In Unit 4, you encountered many situations in which the Nash equilibrium of some social interaction is not Pareto efficient. Examples include the prisoners dilemma and the public goods game.

We use the Nash equilibrium: This concept helps us predict what outcomes we will observe when people interact.
We use Pareto efficiency: This concept evaluates whether there is some other outcome in which all parties might have done better (or at least as well).

Recall from Unit 8 that in the model we illustrated with the bread market, there were no unexploited opportunities for mutual gain at the competitive equilibrium (where the demand and supply curves intersect). In this situation, it is not possible to make one of the buyers or sellers better offby having one of them trade more or less with their exchange partner, for examplewithout making at least one of them worse off. The outcome therefore was Pareto efficient.
This is not the case in the labour market. Competition among many buyers (firms hiring employees) and sellers (people seeking work) results in an equilibrium outcomethe wage w* and the level of employment N*that is not Pareto efficient. What this means is that there is some other outcomea different wage and level of employment that is feasible from the standpoint of the available resources and technologythat both employers and employees would prefer.
To see this, imagine that we are at the equilibrium of the labour market and one of the unemployed workers (identical to those employed) goes to an employer and says: Give me a break. Ill work as hard as the rest of your work force, but you can pay me a little less.
The employer thinks: If I pay him a slightly lower wage, and if he works as hard as the rest, then my profits will go up.
For the unemployed worker, getting a job makes a big difference. She now receives an employment rent, which measures how much better it is for her to have a job than not. The deal is a good one for her despite the fact that the employment rent she receives is slightly lower than that received by other workers (because her wage is slightly lower).
This little example shows that there is some other technically feasible outcomeemploy N* + 1 workers at the wage w* for N* of them and w* minus a little bit for the last worker hiredthat would be an improvement for both the unemployed worker and the employer. So the outcome (N*, w*) is Pareto inefficient.
But if that is the case, why doesnt the employer hire the unemployed person? The answer is that the deal, while technically feasible, is not economically possible. This is because there is no way to enforce the unemployed persons promise to work as hard as the rest in return for a slightly lower wage. Remember the w* on the wage-setting curve is the minimum the firm can pay to identical workers to ensure work effort is adequate. The problem thus goes back to a fundamental fact about the relationship between the firm and its employees: the contract is incomplete in that it cannot ensure a given level of effort from the worker. The Nash equilibrium in the labour market is Pareto inefficient.
The politics and sociology of markets
Here is another difference between the bread market and the barista market. The baker probably does not know the name of the person buying the bread, or anything about the buyer other than that he is offering the right price for the loaf. The buyer most likely cares equally little about the baker other than the taste of the bread.
Now think about the barista. What are the chances that she does not know the name of her immediate supervisor? And vice versa?
Why the difference? The bread market tends to be a one-off interaction among virtual strangers, while the labour market is an ongoing interaction among people who not only know each others names but also care about what the other person is like.
The baristas supervisor cares about what the barista is like because her personality, loyalty to the brand, and her respect for social norms such as honesty and hard work will influence the quality and quantity of effort that she puts into the job. The buyer of the bread does not care about these aspects of the baker because what matters is the quality of the loaf, which can be easily determined, and a new bakery readily found if the taste is not right.
Another major difference is that the supervisor directs what the barista doesto dress a certain way, to show up at work at a certain time, and to not waste time on the jobwith the expectation that she will comply with his orders. Because she receives an employment rent which she would lose if he were to dismiss her, he can exercise power over her, getting her to do things that she might not do without the threat of dismissal.
This is not the case in the bread market. If the buyer complains about the bakers attire, he would be invited to shop elsewhere. The difference is that neither the buyer nor the seller in the bread market is receiving a rent. For each of them, the transaction they are undertaking yields them benefits virtually identical to their next best alternative. When both can walk away at virtually no cost, then neither can exercise power over the other.
These are some of the differencesboth economic and also political and sociologicalbetween the bread market and the barista market. These are also the reasons why the model of the bread market with price-taking buyers and sellers, and market clearing in equilibrium, does not work for the labour market. The table in Figure 9.27 summarizes the differences.






Market
Bread: a market clearing equilibrium of price-takers
Baristas: price-setting by employers and equilibrium unemployment




Buyers
Individual consumers
Firms (employers)


Sellers
Firms (shops)
Individual workers


What is sold?
A loaf of bread
The workers time


What does the buyer want?
A loaf of bread
The employees effort on the job; not the workers time


Competition among sellers?
Yes: There are many bakeries competing to sell bread.
Yes: There are many actual or would-be baristas competing to sell their time.


Is the contract complete?
Yes: If the bag labeled bread did not contain bread, you get your money back.
No: The firms profits depend on the workers effort per hour/week/month worked, which is not in the contract.


Price-taking buyers?
Yes: Individual buyers cannot bargain for a lower price than others are willing to pay (and would not want to pay more).
No: The buyer (the firm) sets the wage to minimize the cost of getting the worker to work; it cannot benefit by offering the lowest wage at which the worker (the seller) would accept the job.


Is there excess supply or demand in equilibrium?
No: The market clears. Sales take place at the lowest price the seller would accept.
Yes: Firms offer a wage higher than the workers reservation wage (minimum price the seller would accept) to maximize their profits.

Question 9.12 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements are correct?

Contracts are complete in both competitive goods markets and labour markets.
In a competitive goods market the buyers are price-takers, while in a labour market the buyers of employment (the firms) are price-setters.
There is no economic rent for either the buyers or the sellers in competitive goods markets. In contrast, in labour markets the sellers receive economic rents.
Social norms do not affect the outcomes in either goods markets or in labour markets.


In a competitive goods market, if what you buy is not what is advertised, then you can pursue the seller in court to ensure that the contract is fulfilled. In a labour market, the contract is for the employees work time, and not for the work (or the effort) itself, and therefore it is incomplete.
In a competitive goods market, individual buyers cannot bargain for a lower price than others are willing to pay. Therefore they are price-takers. In the labour market the firms set the wage to minimize the cost of getting the worker to work and would not benefit by offering the lowest wage at which the worker (the seller) would accept the job. Hence they are price-setters.
In a competitive goods market, the buyers next best alternative is to buy at another shop, while the sellers next best alternative is to sell to another customer. Neither party is any worse off from leaving and therefore they do not receive economic rents. In contrast, in the labour market the sellers (the employees) are worse off in their alternative of being unemployed. Hence they receive employment rents.
In goods markets, contracts are enforced, if necessary, by courts and not by norms. On the other hand, in labour markets the employees work ethic and/or feelings of reciprocity towards their employer affect their productivity on the job.
