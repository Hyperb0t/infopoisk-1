20.2 Climate change
Many scientists now see climate change as the greatest threat to future human wellbeing. We focus on climate change because of its importance as an environmental problem, and because it illustrates the difficulties of designing and implementing adequate environmental policies. This problem tests our framework of efficiency and fairness to the limit, because of five features that climate change shares with other environmental problems:

greenhouse gasGasesmainly water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and ozonereleased in the earths atmosphere that lead to increases in atmospheric temperature and changes in climate.


Stabilizing yearly emissions is not sufficient: Climate is affected by the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is increasing due to the annual flow of emissions. But merely stabilizing emissions at current levels will not be enough, because the stock of greenhouses gases would then continue to increase.
Irreversibility of climate change: Increases in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere are partially irreversible, which means that our current actions have long-lasting effects on future generations.
The worst-case scenario: Experts are uncertain about the scale, timing, and global pattern of the effects of climate change, but most agree that climate change could be catastrophic. Therefore, the most likely scenario should not be the only guide to policy. We need to take into account a range of possible scenarios, including some very unlikely but disastrous ones.
A global problem requiring international cooperation: The contributions to climate change come from all parts of the world, and its effects will be felt by all of nearly 200 autonomous nations. It will be solved only by a high level of cooperation between the largest and most powerful nations, at a minimum, on a scale without historical precedent.
Conflicts of interest: The impacts of climate change differ among people according to their economic circumstances, both across the globe and within countries. Future generations will experience the effects of todays emissions, but also the actions we take to reduce them. It is unclear how to balance the competing interests of individuals in different economic circumstances, and the interests of current and future generations.

Climate change and economic activity
Figure 20.6 shows the data on the stock of CO2 (in parts per million) using the right-hand scale, and global temperature (as the deviation from the average over the period 19611990) using the left-hand scale, for the period since 1750.

Temperature is average northern hemisphere temperature.



Burning fossil fuels for power generation and industrial use leads to emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. These activities, together with CO2 emissions from land-use changes, generate greenhouse gases equivalent to around 36billion tonnes of CO2 each year. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased from 280 parts per million in 1800 to 400 parts per million, currently rising at 23 parts per million each year. CO2 allows incoming sunlight to pass through it, but traps reflected heat on the earth, leading to increases in atmospheric temperatures and changes in climate. Some CO2 also gets absorbed into the oceans. This increases the acidity of the oceans, killing marine life.
Figure 20.6 illustrates a key fact of climate science: that global warming is an effect of the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To use the language of Unit 10, where we discussed income (a flow) and wealth (a stock), climate change is caused by the stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases, not by the flow of our annual emissions. Its whats in the tub that matters. Figure 20.7 presents this new use of the bathtub model to illustrate the problem.

Another bathtub model: The stock of atmospheric CO2.
        




The increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is occurring because the processes reducing the stock (natural decay of the CO2 and absorption of CO2 by forests) are far less than the new emissions that we add annually. Moreover, deforestation in the Amazon, Indonesia and elsewhere is reducing the CO2 outflows while also adding to CO2 emissions. These forests are often replaced by agricultural activities that produce further greenhouse gas emissions in the form of methane releases from livestock and nitrous oxide releases from fertilizer overuse.

Martin Weitzman argues there is a non-trivial risk of a catastrophe from climate change in an EconTalk podcast.

The natural decay of CO2 is extraordinarily slow. Of the carbon dioxide that humans have put in the atmosphere since the mass burning of coal that started in the Industrial Revolution, two-thirds will still be there a hundred years from now. More than a third of it will still be in the tub a thousand years from now. The natural processes that stabilized greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in pre-industrial times have been entirely overwhelmed by human economic activity. And the imbalance is accelerating.
It is estimated that we can emit only a further 1 to 1.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere to give reasonable odds of limiting the increase in temperature to 2C above pre-industrial levels. Should we manage to achieve this limit on emissions, there is still a probability of around 1% that temperature increases would be more than 6C, causing a global economic catastrophe. If we exceed the limit and temperature rises to 3.4C above pre-industrial levels, the probability of a climate-induced economic catastrophe would rise to 10%.1
To support the objective, the IPCC published a special report in 2018, according to which global warming in excess of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would mean a significant increase in temporary and permanent damage to people, species and ecosystems.
Figure 20.8 shows the relationship between estimated temperature increases and CO2 emitted. It also shows the amount of CO2 that would be emitted if we:

reserves (natural resource)The amount of a natural resource that is economically feasible to extract given existing technologies. See also: resources (natural).


burnt the fossil fuels that can be economically extracted at current prices and technology (reserves)
burnt all fossil fuels in the earths crust (resources)

Figure 20.8 indicates that keeping the warming to 2C implies that the majority of fossil fuel reserves and resources should remain in the ground.

Exercise 20.1 Assessing the economic impacts of global warming
In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius estimated the impact of doubling CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, and later suggested that the colder regions of the earth might want to burn more coal so as to enjoy a better climate.
In the next century, entire countries may disappear as the level of the oceans rise in response to the melting of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.

Exercise 20.2 Climate change causes and evidence
Use information from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration web page on climate change, and the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to answer the following questions:

Explain what climate scientists believe to be the main causes of climate change.
What evidence is there to indicate that climate change is already occurring?
Name and explain three potential consequences of climate change in the future.
Discuss why the three consequences you have listed may lead to disagreements and conflicts of interest about climate policy. (Hint: You may find it useful to draw on your answers to Exercise 20.1 about the winners and losers from climate change.)



Question 20.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 20.8 shows the temperature increase arising from the CO2 emitted, generated at different levels of use of fossil fuel reserves (which can be technically and economically extracted) and resources (estimated total amounts) in the earths crust. For example, it states that a further 1 to 1.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 emissions would be likely to lead to a 2C increase in temperature, compared to the pre-industrial average.
You are also given that 36 billion tonnes of CO2 are generated each year currently. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The figure suggests that the world should stop using coal immediately.
Using up all the reserves but none of the resources should keep the temperature from rising more than 2C.
Limiting further CO2 emissions to 1 to 1.5 trillion tonnes will ensure that the temperature will not rise more than 2C.
Stabilizing the emission rate at the current level will not be enough to prevent the possibility of a climate-induced economic catastrophe.


False. Whether we should stop using coal depends on the costs of further temperature increases relative to the benefits of coal use.
False. Temperatures would increase by 3C if we used all fossil fuel reserves.
False. 1 to 1.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 emission would be likely to lead to a 2C increase in temperature. However, larger increases in temperature are possible due to uncertainty concerning the link between emissions and temperature.
True. Stabilizing emissions will cause a constant increase in the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to further temperature increases.
