18.2 Globalization and investment
As in commodity markets, in international capital markets there is a similar pattern of nineteenth century globalization, followed by a brief episode of interwar deglobalization, and late twentieth century reglobalization.
If countries existed in isolation, they would have to finance their investment needs using their own savings. If this were the case, they could not spend more than they earned in a year, and all their income would have to be spent domestically. Domestic expenditure would have to equal domestic income. In reality, we see lending and borrowing across borders, between individuals, financial institutions, companies, and governments. To keep the language simple, lets talk about countries lending to or borrowing from other countries, bearing in mind the fact that these countries are not actors themselves but are made up of many individuals, companies, and institutions. A country can spend more than it earns by borrowing from abroad. Similarly a country can decide not to use its savings to finance domestic investment, and instead lend it abroad and earn a return on these foreign loans. In this case, its savings will exceed domestic investment, or (equivalently) its income will be higher than its expenditure.

Balance of payments account (BP)
Records all payment transactions between the home country and the rest of the world and is divided into two parts: the current account and the capital and financial account.

If there is a current account surplus, this is a source of foreign exchange and it is either used to purchase foreign assets such as factories (FDI) or financial assets (recorded as a private net capital outflow) or it adds to the home countrys official foreign exchange reserves. As a consequence, the home countrys wealth rises. The opposite is the case for a current account deficit.

We use the balance of payments accounts to track lending and borrowing abroad. We first need to explain how lending and borrowing abroad is related to international trade in goods and services. This is because imports represent payments from the domestic economy to the rest of the world, while exports represent payments from the rest of the world to the domestic economy. The balance of payments records the sources and uses of foreign exchange. If the records of transactions were complete, the balance would sum to zero because the source and use of each dollar crossing an international border could be accounted for (in reality, an entry called errors and omissions is added to the balance of payments accounts to make it sum to zero).
To see how the balance of payments accounts work, think first about an economy where the only international payments are due to trade. If the home country imports more than it exports, then its residents are making more international payments than they are receiving. For example, a country buying a higher value of imports from the US than it receives from selling its exports to the US needs to get hold of the US dollarsby borrowing from the US or the rest of the worldto cover the difference.
Conversely, if the home country is exporting more than it is importing, then its nationals must be lending to their trading partners so they can pay for the exports. These loans are a use of foreign exchange for the home country, and a source of foreign exchange for its trade partners.
Thus a trade deficit will imply that the country is borrowing, while a trade surplus implies it is lending (which is equivalent to saving, as we saw in Unit 10).

foreign portfolio investmentThe acquisition of bonds or shares in a foreign country where the holdings of the foreign assets are not sufficiently great to give the owner substantial control over the owned entity. Foreign direct investment (FDI), by contrast, entails ownership and substantial control over the owned assets. See also: foreign direct investment.foreign direct investment (FDI)Ownership and substantial control over assets in a foreign country. See also: foreign portfolio investment.

There are other reasons that people in one country make payments to people in another. The most important is the purchase of assets in another country. If a US company purchases shares in a company in China, it is making a payment for a Chinese asset. This implies a payment from the US to China. This is a use of foreign exchange called foreign portfolio investment. Similarly, if a US company purchases a factory in China, this is a use of foreign exchange called foreign direct investment (FDI).

remittancesMoney sent home by international migrant workers to their families or others in the migrants home country. In countries which either supply or receive large numbers of migrant workers, this is an important international capital flow.

In subsequent years, however, the US company will receive dividends from its portfolio investment or profits from its direct investment, which will be sent back (repatriated) to the US company. These repatriated profits are payments from China to the US. They are recorded in the US balance of payments as a source of foreign exchange.
Other important international payments include money sent home by migrant workers to their families (called remittances) and official aid flows, mostly from the governments of rich to poor countries.

Current account (CA)
The sum of all payments made to a country minus all payments made by the country.

Since the current account includes all international payments, it also tells us directly whether a country is borrowing or lending:

CA deficit: This means the country is borrowingit has to do so to cover the excess payments it is making to the rest of the world.
CA surplus: This means the country is lending (saving) to allow other countries to send it the excess payments.


All of these international payments are tracked in the balance of payments accounts, and the net value of these payments is called the current account (CA)so the CA is the sum of all payments made to a country minus all payments made by the country. A country might have a trade deficitthat is, import more than it is exportingbut still have a current account surplus if it is receiving more than enough income from its foreign investments, remittances or foreign aid to pay the difference. In this case it will not need to borrow. For simplicity we ignore remittances and international aid and assume that the current account is equal to exports (X) minus imports (M) plus net earnings from assets owned abroad.

current account deficitThe excess of the value of a countrys imports over the combined value of its exports plus its net earnings from assets abroad. See also: current account, current account surplus.current account surplusThe excess of the combined value of its exports and net earnings from assets abroad over the value of its imports. See also: current account, current account deficit.net capital flowsThe borrowing and lending tracked by the current account. See also: current account, current account deficit, current account surplus.

The borrowing and lending tracked by the current account are known as net capital flows. In this context, capital refers to money that is being lent and borrowed, rather than capital goods. A country that is borrowing (has a CA deficit) is receiving net capital flowsit is borrowing cash in order to cover its CA deficit. This cash will have to be paid back in the future, so capital inflows also represent rising foreign debt for the country. If the borrowed money is used for productive investments though, the investment can help generate the income needed to repay the debt. Thus, when a country wants to invest more than it can afford using its own savings, borrowing from abroad can be used to finance the extra investment.
Historically, increased trade tends to lead to larger CA imbalances. That is, when countries trade more, they also tend to borrow and lend more. The measure shown in Figure 18.8 is the sum of the absolute values of the current account balances of 15 countries from 1870 to 2014. We add up the absolute value of the current accounts to capture both borrowing and lending across countries.

As with commodity trade (Figure 18.6), the volume of capital flows in Figure 18.8 reflects a pattern of interrupted globalization. During the late nineteenth century there were huge capital flows from northwest Europe where there were current account surplusesthe UK especially, but also France and Germanywhich financed investment in railways and infrastructure in countries such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the US. These were all countries with abundant and underexploited natural resources, especially land, but railways had to be extended into the interior in order to exploit these resources, and the land had to be settled with immigrants. In Europe, the countries that succeeded in attracting foreign investment during this period, such as Russia and Sweden, were also relatively resource-abundant. The investments made a healthy return, since they increased the productive capacity of the borrowing countries, who were able to pay back the loans with interest based on the increased incomes that they enjoyed as a result.
In the interwar period these capital flows fell sharplyespecially after the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, which had led many countries to impose strict limits on the movement of capital across frontiers. These limits on capital flows meant that countries had to keep their current account deficits and surpluses relatively low they prevented the capital inflows that would be required to finance large current account deficits. Unlike international trade, which resumed growth soon after the end of the Second World War, capital controls persisted for longer and only started to be relaxed in the 1970s and 1980s. Since then capital flows have increased sharply, although not yet to their dizzying heights of the early twentieth century.
Figure 18.9 shows how international asset holdings evolved during the twentieth century. The pattern is U-shaped. For the rich countries that dominated international lending, the share of foreign assets divided by GDP was high in the early part of the century, but collapsed in the 1930s. After 1945, New York took over from London as the global financial centre and the US eclipsed Britain as the dominant international asset holder.

To measure price gaps in international capital markets, we need prices of identical financial assets in different countries. Where researchers have been able to locate such prices, they have found that the late nineteenth century saw significant globalization in capital flows.
For most of the nineteenth century, if a would-be arbitrageur in New York (or London) wished to act on a price gap between New York and London, the speed at which information travelled limited his opportunities (we tracked the speed at which information travelled over the past 1,000 years in Unit 1). Information about price gaps travelled on ships that crossed the Atlantic. By the time the arbitrageur learned of the price gap, the information was already several days out of date. To act on it, he had to send written instructions to his agent in the other city to buy or sell. These instructions travelled by ship too. It took a large price gap, therefore, to create speculation, since prices may have changed by the time the orders made it across the Atlantic.
In 1866, investors in London and New York (and their agents) could, for the first time, communicate with each other on the same day. They were using the first transatlantic telegraph cable, running from Ireland to Newfoundland in Canada. Once the cable was installed, investors could act immediately when they heard of a potential arbitrage opportunity, and price gaps immediately collapsed.
In most countries, residents and companies do the majority of investment. One dimension of globalization is the foreign direct investment (FDI) mentioned earlier by companies abroad, including subsidiaries. Unlike the use of savings to buy foreign bonds or shares in a foreign company (portfolio investment), the intention of FDI is to exercise control over the use of resources in the foreign company.
Figure 18.10 shows the destination of investments by US companies when they invested directly in other companies abroad between 2001 and 2012. Perhaps surprisingly, when US firms chose to produce outside the US, they mostly went to countries in Europe; and in Europe, largely to countries in which wages were higher than in the US. The Netherlands, Germany, and the UK alone received more US investment than Asia and Africa combined. In this respect the location of Ford plants around the world shown in Figure 18.1 is not typical, because Ford has far more employees in China, Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa combined than in Germany, UK, Canada, Belgium, and France combined.

Exercise 18.3 International capital flows: Doescapital flow from richer to poorer countries?

China has enjoyed a period of rapid development over recent decades. Using data from FRED, plot Chinas current account balance over the period 19982012, and describe how it has evolved since the late 1990s (Hint: search for total current account balance for China). Make sure to highlight whether it is a CA surplus or deficit.
On the same graph, plot the current account balance of the US over the same time period, and compare it with Chinas current account balance (you can also find the data for the US at FRED by searching for total current account balance for United States).
What does your graph suggest about capital flows between richer and poorer countries? Read the 2007 article The paradox of capital by Eswar Prasad, Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian, who are IMF economists. Explain what is meant by capital flowing uphill and whether or not it is a paradox.
Look at Figure 18.8 and note that international capital flows (as measured by average absolute current account balances as a proportion of GDP) in the first decades of the twenty-first century are similar to those of the late nineteenth century. Using the discussion of capital flows in this section and in the article from question 3, was capital flowing uphill during Globalization I or Globalization II? Why, or why not?



Question 18.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements regarding current accounts is correct, ceteris paribus?

An increase in the trade surplus would lead to a decrease in a countrys current account.
A country with zero trade balance but historically high foreign direct investment would always have a current account deficit.
An increase in remittances by a countrys nationals abroad would lead to a lower current account.
An increase in the official aid payment sent to other countries means a lower current account.


An increase in the trade surplus means a larger exportimport gap. The country would then be receiving more international payments, resulting in an increase in its current account.
A country with historically high FDI may have high dividend receipts from these investments. Given a zero trade balance, when the net investment earnings are positive the current account would be in surplus.
Remittance is where migrant nationals send money back to their families at home. This would increase the home countrys current account.
Aid money sent abroad directly reduces a countrys current account. In the longer run however, it may help stimulate new export markets.
