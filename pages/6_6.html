6.5 Determinants of the employment rent
To construct a model of how employment rents may be used to motivate employees to work hard, we consider Maria, an employee earning $12 an hour for a 35-hour working week. To determine her economic rent, we need to think how she would evaluate two aspects of her job:

The pay that she gets: which is something she values.
How hard she works: she would like to do no more work than is necessary.


utilityA numerical indicator of the value that one places on an outcome, such that higher valued outcomes will be chosen over lower valued ones when both are feasible.

Using the concept of utility introduced in Unit 3, we can say that Marias utility is increased by the goods and services she can buy with her wage, but reduced by the unpleasantness of going to work and working hard all daythe disutility of work.
Her disutility of work depends on how much effort she puts into her job. Suppose she spends half of her working time actually working, and half doing other things like checking Facebook. We represent this as an effort level of 0.5. Working this hard is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour to Maria. To calculate her employment rent we first find her net utility of working and earning $12, compared with being unemployed and earning nothing:

This is her employment rent per hour. The total employment rent (or cost of job loss), depends on how long she expects to remain unemployed. We will suppose that if she loses her job she can expect to remain unemployed for 44 weeks before finding another. The analysis in Figure 6.2 shows how to calculate the rent.












Figure 6.2 
Marias employment rent for a given effort and $12 wage in an economy without an unemployment benefit.
        















Marias wage


Marias hourly wage, after taxes and other deductions, is $12. Looking ahead from now (taken as time 0), she will continue to receive this wage for the foreseeable future if she keeps her job, indicated by the horizontal line at the top of the figure.














The disutility of working


Marias current effort level is 0.5: she pursues non-work activities for half of the time on the job. Working this hard is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour to Maria.














The net benefit of working


The difference between her wage and disutility of effort is the economic rent per hour that she receives while employed.














If Maria loses her job


If instead Maria were to lose her job at time 0, she would no longer receive her wages. This unfortunate state would persist as long as she remains unemployed, indicated by the horizontal line at the bottom of the figure.














The duration of unemployment


The expected duration of unemployment is 44 weeks, where she would have worked 35 hours per week. That is how long she will remain without pay (and without the disutility of working).














Maria finds a job


Maria expects to find another job at the same wage after 44 weeks.














Marias employment rent


The shaded area is her total cost of job loss from the spell of unemployment, that is, her employment rent.




Her total employment rent is the employment rent per hour times the number of hours of work she will lose if her job is terminated. It is the shaded area in the figure.


unemployment benefitA government transfer received by an unemployed person. Also known as: unemployment insurance

People who lose their jobs can typically expect help from family and friends while they are out of work. Also, in many economies, people who lose their jobs receive unemployment benefit or financial assistance from the government. In poorer economies, they may be able to earn a small amount in informal self-employment.

reservation wageWhat an employee would get in alternative employment, or from an unemployment benefit or other support, were he or she not employed in his or her current job.

If Maria receives an unemployment benefit or income from any of these sources, it will partially offset the lost wage income. Let us suppose that while Maria remains unemployed, she will receive a benefit equivalent to being paid $6 an hour for a 35-hour week. This is her reservation wage, which is the lowest wage that would induce her to accept a job in which she did not experience any disutility of work.
In Figure 6.2 we show Marias situation where she is working hard at a job and incurring a disutility of effort of $2 per hour on the job. There is no unemployment benefit so her reservation wage is zero. With a wage of $12, her employment rent is $10 per hour. This is what she would lose, were she to lose her job and be unemployed.
In Figure 6.3, we add an unemployment benefit of $6. Working as hard as before and experiencing $2 disutility of effort per hour, her employment rent is now the wage of $12 minus the disutility of effort ($2) minus the reservation wage ($6), i.e. a rent of $4 per hour. She would now lose $4 per hour, were she to lose her job and be unemployed.











Figure 6.3 
Marias employment rent for a given effort and a $12 wage in an economy with an unemployment benefit of $6 of unlimited duration.
        




Our calculation of employment rent should take into account the reservation wage:

And taking account of the duration of unemployment we see that:

Unemployment benefits usually run out eventually: families and friends will not be able to help forever, and government unemployment benefits are often time-limited. If Marias eligibility for unemployment benefits of $6 lasted only for 13 weeks, her reservation wage would not be $6she would not be indifferent between a job that paid $6 an hour and unemployment. The employment rent would be higher and her reservation wage would be lower, because the average level of benefits she could expect over the 44-week period of unemployment would be much less than $6.

Exercise 6.3 Assumptions of the model
As in all economic models, our simplified representation of Marias employment rent has deliberately omitted some aspects of the problem that might be important. For example, we have assumed that:

Maria finds a job with the same pay after her spell of unemployment.
She does not experience any psychological or social costs from being unemployed.

Redraw Figure 6.2 to show how relaxing each of these assumptions would alter the employment rent. Specifically, assume:

Maria can only find a job with the lower pay of $6 per hour after her spell of unemployment.
She experiences a psychological cost of being unemployed of $1 per hour. When unemployed, she gains $2 per hour because there is no longer the disutility of working so the net gain is $1.


Our next step is to study the social interaction between the employer (who sets the wage knowing that it affects Marias employment rent) and Maria herself, whose decision on how hard to work is influenced by the rent.

Question 6.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Maria earns $12 per hour in her current job and works 35 hours a week. Her disutility of effort is equivalent to a cost of $2 per hour of work. If she loses her job, she will receive unemployment benefit equivalent to $6 per hour. Additionally, being unemployed has psychological and social costs equivalent to $1 per hour. Then:

The employment rent per hour is $3.
Marias reservation wage is $6 per hour.
Marias employment rent if she can get another job with the same wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is $6,160.
Marias employment rent if she can only get a job at a lower wage rate after 44 weeks of being unemployed is more than $7,700.


Employment rent per hour = wage  unemployment benefit  disutility of effort + disutility of unemployment = 12  6  2 + 1 = $5. This is the net hourly benefit of being employed compared with unemployment.
Marias reservation wage = unemployment benefit  disutility of unemployment = 6  1 = $5. This is the wage at which Maria is just willing to forgo her unemployment benefits for a job (but it is not enough to make her put in effort!).
Marias employment rent = $5 (employment rent per hour)  35 hours per week  44 weeks = $7,700.
If she could get a job at the same wage after 44 weeks, Marias employment rent = $5 (employment rent per hour)  35 hours per week  44 weeks = $7,700. If the new job were to have a lower wage, her employment rent in the current job would be higher than $7,700.
