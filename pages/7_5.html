7.4 Demand and isoprofit curves: Beautiful Cars

differentiated productA product produced by a single firm that has some unique characteristics compared to similar products of other firms.

Not all cars are the same. Cars are differentiated products. Each make and model is produced by just one firm, and has some unique characteristics of design and performance that differentiate it from the cars made by other firms.
We expect a firm selling a differentiated product to face a downward-sloping demand curve. We have already seen an empirical example in the case of Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios (another differentiated product). If the price of a Beautiful Car is high, demand will be low because the only consumers who will buy it are those who strongly prefer Beautiful Cars to all other makes. As the price falls, more consumers, who might otherwise have purchased a Ford or a Volvo, will be attracted to a Beautiful Car.
The demand curve
For any product that consumers might wish to buy, the product demand curve is a relationship that tells you the number of items (the quantity) they will buy at each possible price. For a simple model of the demand for Beautiful Cars, imagine that there are 100 potential consumers who would each buy one Beautiful Car today, if the price were low enough.

willingness to pay (WTP)An indicator of how much a person values a good, measured by the maximum amount he or she would pay to acquire a unit of the good. See also: willingness to accept.

Each consumer has a willingness to pay (WTP) for a Beautiful Car, which depends on how much the customer personally values it (given the resources to buy it, of course). A consumer will buy a car if the price is less than or equal to his or her WTP. Suppose we line up the consumers in order of WTP, with the highest first, and plot a graph to show how the WTP varies along the line (Figure 7.9). Then if we choose any price, say P=$3,200, the graph shows the number of consumers whose WTP is greater than or equal to P. In this case, 60 consumers are willing to pay $3,200 or more, so the demand for cars at a price of $3,200 is 60.

The Law of Demand dates back to the seventeenth century, and is attributed to Gregory King (16481712) and Charles Davenant (16561714). King was a herald at the College of Arms in London, who produced detailed estimates of the population and wealth of England. Davenant, a politician, published the Davenant-King Law of Demand in 1699, using Kings data. It described how the price of corn would change depending on the size of the harvest. For example, he calculated that a defect, or shortfall, of one-tenth (10%) would raise the price by 30%.

If P is lower, there are a larger number of consumers willing to buy, so the demand is higher. Demand curves are often drawn as straight lines, as in this example, although there is no reason to expect them to be straight in reality: we saw that the demand curve for Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios was not straight. But we do expect demand curves to slope downward: as the price rises, the quantity that consumers demand falls. In other words, when the available quantity is low, it can be sold at a high price. This relationship between price and quantity is sometimes known as the Law of Demand.

Question 7.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
The diagram depicts two alternative demand curves, D and D, for a product. Based on this graph, which of the following are correct?













On demand curve D, when the price is 5,000, the firm can sell 15 units of the product.
On demand curve D, the firm can sell 70 units at a price of 3,000.
At price 1,000, the firm can sell 40 more units of the product on D than on D.
With an output of 30 units, the firm can charge 2,000 more on D than on D.


On demand curve D, when the price is 5,000, the firm can sell 10 units.
When Q = 70, the corresponding price on D is 3,000.
D can be seen as just a rightward shift of D, by 40 units. So for any price, the firm can sell 40 more units on D than on D.
With an output of 30 units, the firm can charge 4,000 more on D than on D.


Like the producer of Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios, Beautiful Cars will choose the price, P, and the quantity, Q, taking into account its demand curve and its production costs. The demand curve determines the feasible set of combinations of P and Q. To find the profit-maximizing point, we will draw the isoprofit curves, and look for the point of tangency as before.
The isoprofit curves
The firms profit is the difference between its revenue (the price multiplied by quantity sold) and its total costs, C(Q):


economic profitA firms revenue minus its total costs (including the opportunity cost of capital).normal profitsCorresponds to zero economic profit and means that the rate of profit is equal to the opportunity cost of capital. See also: economic profit, opportunity cost of capital.

This calculation gives us what is known as the economic profit. Remember that the cost function includes the opportunity cost of capital (the payments that must be made to the owners to induce them to hold shares), which is referred to as normal profits. Economic profit is the additional profit above the minimum return required by shareholders.
Equivalently, profit is the number of units of output multiplied by the profit per unit, which is the difference between the price and the average cost:

From this equation you can see that the shape of the isoprofit curves will depend on the shape of the average cost curve. Remember that for Beautiful Cars, the average cost curve slopes downward until Q = 40, and then upward. Figure 7.10 shows the corresponding isoprofit curves. They look similar to those for Cheerios in Figure 7.3, but there are some differences because the average cost function has a different shape. The lowest (lightest blue) curve shows the zero-economic-profit curve: the combinations of price and quantity for which economic profit is equal to zero, because the price is just equal to the average cost at each quantity.












Figure 7.10 
Isoprofit curves for Beautiful Cars.
        















The zero-economic-profit curve


The lightest blue curve is the firms average cost curve. If P = AC, the firms economic profit is zero. So the AC curve is also the zero-profit curve: it shows all the combinations of P and Q that give zero economic profit.














The shape of the zero-economic-profit curve


Beautiful Cars has decreasing AC when Q < 40, and increasing AC when Q > 40. When Q is low, it needs a high price to break even. If Q = 40 it could break even with a price of $3,400. For Q > 40, it would need to raise the price again to avoid a loss.














AC and MC


Beautiful Cars has increasing marginal costs: the upward-sloping line. Remember that the AC curve slopes down if AC > MC, and up if AC < MC. The two curves cross at B, where AC is lowest.














Isoprofit curves


The darker blue curves show the combinations of P and Q giving higher levels of profit, so points G and K give the same profit.














Profit = Q(P  AC)


At G where the firm makes 23 cars, the price is $6,820 and the average cost is $3,777. The firm makes a profit of $3,043 on each car, and its total profit is $70,000.














Higher prices, higher profits


Profit is higher on the curves closer to the top-right corner in the diagram. Point H has the same quantity as K, so the average cost is the same, but the price is higher at H.




Notice that in Figure 7.10:

Isoprofit curves slope downward at points where P > MC.
Isoprofit curves slope upward at points where P < MC.


profit marginThe difference between the price and the marginal cost.

The difference between the price and the marginal cost is called the profit margin. At any point on an isoprofit curve the slope is given by:

To understand why, think again about point G in Figure 7.10 at which Q=23, and the price is much higher than the marginal cost. If you:

increase Q by 1
reduce P by (P  MC)/Q

then your profit will stay the same because the extra profit of (P  MC) on car 24 will be offset by a fall in revenue of (P  MC) on the other 23 cars.
Leibniz: Isoprofit curves and their slopes
The same reasoning applies at every point where P > MC. The profit margin is positive so the slope is negative. And it also applies when P < MC. In this case, the profit margin is negative so an increase in price is required to keep profit constant when quantity rises by 1. The isoprofit curve slopes upward.

Question 7.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
The diagram depicts the marginal cost curve (MC), the average cost curve (AC), and the isoprofit curves of a firm. What can we deduce from the information in the diagram?













The profit level at A is 500.
The profit level at B is 150.
The price at C is 50.
The price at B is 36.


The profit at any point on the AC curve is zero (since the price equals the average cost, and profit = quantity sold  (price  average cost)).
The profit level for the isoprofit curve going through B can be calculated at Q = 10, where AC = 20 and P = 40. So the profit is (40  20)  10 = 200.
The profit level for the isoprofit curve going through C can be calculated at Q = 10, where AC = 20, and P = 70. So the profit is (70  20)  10 = 500. At C, Q = 20, so profit per unit is (P  AC) = 25. Since AC is 25, P must be 50.
The profit level for the isoprofit curve going through B can be calculated at Q = 10, where AC = 20 and P = 40. So the profit is (40  20)  10 = 200. At B, Q = 20, so profit per unit is (P  AC) = 10. Since AC is 25, P must be 35.



Exercise 7.4 Looking at isoprofit curves
The isoprofit curves for Cheerios are downward-sloping, but for Beautiful Cars they slope downward when Q is low and upward when Q is high.

In both cases the higher isoprofit curves get closer to the average cost curve as quantity increases. Why?
What is the reason for the difference in the shape of the isoprofit curves between the two firms?
