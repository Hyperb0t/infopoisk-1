7.2 Economies of scale and the cost advantages of large-scale production
Why have firms like Walmart, Intel and FedEx grown so large? An important reason why a large firm may be more profitable than a small firm is that the large firm produces its output at lower cost per unit. This may be possible for two reasons:


Technological advantages: Large-scale production often uses fewer inputs per unit of output.


Cost advantages: In larger firms, fixed costs such as advertising or acquiring the necessary patents or other intellectual property rights (IPR) have a smaller effect on the cost per unit. And they may be able to purchase their inputs at a lower cost because they have more bargaining power.



economies of scaleThese occur when doubling all of the inputs to a production process more than doubles the output. The shape of a firms long-run average cost curve depends both on returns to scale in production and the effect of scale on the prices it pays for its inputs. Also known as: increasing returns to scale. See also: diseconomies of scale.diseconomies of scaleThese occur when doubling all of the inputs to a production process less than doubles the output. Also known as: decreasing returns to scale. See also: economies of scale.constant returns to scaleThese occur when doubling all of the inputs to a production process doubles the output. The shape of a firms long-run average cost curve depends both on returns to scale in production and the effect of scale on the prices it pays for its inputs. See also: increasing returns to scale, decreasing returns to scale.

Economists use the term economies of scale or increasing returns to describe the technological advantages of large-scale production. For example, if doubling the amount of every input that the firm uses triples the firms output, then the firm exhibits increasing returns.

Economies and diseconomies of scale
If we increase all inputs by a given proportion, and it:

increases output more than proportionally, then the technology is said to exhibit increasing returns to scale in production or economies of scale,
increases output less than proportionally, then the technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale in production or diseconomies of scale,
increases output proportionally, then the technology exhibits constant returns to scale in production.


Economies of scale may result from specialization within the firm, which allows employees to do the task they do best, and minimizes training time by limiting the skill set that each worker needs. Economies of scale may also occur for purely engineering reasons. For example, transporting more of a liquid requires a larger pipe, but doubling the capacity of the pipe increases its diameter (and the material necessary to construct it) by much less than a factor of two. For proof, check The size and cost of a pipe in the Einstein at the end of this section.
But there are also built-in diseconomies of scale. Think of the firms owners, managers, work supervisors and production workers. Suppose that each supervisor can direct 10 production workers, while each manager can direct 10 supervisors. If the firm employs 10 production workers, then the owner can do the management and supervision. If it employs 100 production workers, it needs to add a layer of 10 supervisors. If it grows to 1,000 production workers, it will need to recruit another layer of management to supervise the first layer of supervisors. So increasing production workers requires more than a proportional increase in supervision and management. The only way the firm could increase all inputs proportionally would be to reduce the intensity of supervision, with associated losses in productivity. Well call this diseconomy of scale the Dilbert law of firm hierarchy, (after a Dilbert comic strip). See the Einstein at the end of this section for how to calculate the diseconomy of scale that our Dilbert law implies.
Cost advantages

research and developmentExpenditures by a private or public entity to create new methods of production, products, or other economically relevant new knowledge.

Cost per unit may fall as the firm produces more output, even if there are constant or even decreasing returns to scale. This happens if there is a fixed cost that doesnt depend on the number of unitsit will be the same whether the firm produces one unit, or many. An example would be the cost of research and development (R&D) and product design, acquiring a licence to engage in production, or obtaining a patent for a particular technique. Marketing expenses, such as advertising, are another fixed cost. The cost of a 30-second advertisement during the television coverage of the US Super Bowl football game in 2014 was $4 million, which would only be justifiable if a large number of units would be sold as a result.
A firms attempt to gain favourable treatment by government bodies through lobbying, contributions to election campaigns, and public relations expenditures are also a kind of fixed cost. These expenses are more or less independent of the level of the firms output.
Secondly, large firms are able to purchase their inputs on more favourable terms, because they have more bargaining power than small firms when negotiating with suppliers.
Demand advantages

network economies of scaleThese exist when an increase in the number of users of an output of a firm implies an increase in the value of the output to each of them, because they are connected to each other.

Large size may benefit a firm in selling its product, not just in producing it. This occurs when people are more likely to buy a product or service if it already has a lot of users. For example, a software application is more useful when everybody is using a compatible version. These demand-side benefits of scale are called network economies of scale, and there are many examples in technology-related markets.
Production by a small group of people is therefore often too costly to compete with larger firms. But while small firms typically either grow or die, there are limits to growth known as diseconomies of scale, or decreasing returns.
A larger firm needs more layers of management and supervision. Firms typically organize themselves as hierarchies in which employees are supervised by those at a higher level and, as the firm grows, the organizational costs will grow as a proportion of the firms overall costs.
We have already seen in Unit 6 that firms may outsource production of components. Firm growth is limited, in part, because sometimes it is cheaper to purchase part of the product than to manufacture it themselves. Apple would be gigantic if it decided that Apple employees would produce the touch screens, chipsets, and other components that make up the iPhone and iPad rather than purchasing these parts from Toshiba, Samsung, and other suppliers. Apples outsourcing strategy limits the firms size, and increases the size of Toshiba, Samsung, and other firms that produce Apples components.
In the next section, we will model the way that a firms costs depend on its scale of production.

Question 7.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

If a firms technology exhibits constant returns to scale, doubling the inputs leads to doubling of the output level.
If a firms technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale, doubling the inputs more than doubles the output level.
If a firms technology exhibits economies of scale, costs per unit will fall as the firm expands its production.
If a firms technology exhibits diseconomies of scale, doubling the inputs leads to less than doubling of the output level.


With constant returns, increasing the inputs leads to the same proportional increase in output.
With decreasing returns, doubling the inputs levels less than doubles output.
Since the firm can increase output with a less than proportional increase in inputs, its cost per unit will fall.
With decreasing returns, increasing the inputs leads to a less than proportional increase in output.



Einstein The size and cost of a pipe
We can use simple mathematics to work out how much the cost of making a pipe increases when the area of the cross-section doubles. The formula for the area of a circle is:

Let us assume the area of the pipe was originally 10 cm2, and then it was doubled in size to 20 cm2. We can use the equation above to find the radius of the pipe in each case.
When the area of the pipe is 10:

When the area of the pipe is 20:

The cost of the material used to make a pipe of given length is proportional to its circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is:

When the area of the pipe is 10:

When the area of the pipe is 20:

The pipe has doubled in capacity, but the circumference, and hence the cost, has only increased by a factor of:

We can clearly see that the firm has benefitted from economies of scale.
Diseconomies of scale: COREs Dilbert law of firm hierarchy
If every 10 employees at a lower level must have a supervisor at a higher level, then a firm that has 10x production workers (the bottom of the ladder) will have x levels of management, 10x1 supervisors at the lowest level, 10x2 at the second lowest level, and so on.
A firm with 1 million (106) production workers will thus have 100,000 (105 = 1061) lowest-level supervisors. Dilbert did not invent the law. He is too closely watched by his supervisor to have time for that. The CORE team did.
