6.3 Other peoples labour
The firm does not only manage, as Adam Smith put it, other peoples money. The decision-makers in a firm decide on the use of other peoples labour too: the effort of their employees. People participate in firms because they can do better if they are part of the firm than if they are not. As in all voluntary economic interactions, there are mutual gains. But just as conflicts arise between owners and managers, there will generally be differences between owners and managers on the one hand, and employees on the other, about how the firm will use the strength, creativity, and other skills of its employees.
A firms profits (before the payment of taxes) depend on three things:

costs of acquiring the inputs necessary for the production process
output (how much these inputs produce)
sales revenues received from selling goods or services

Our focus here is how firms seek to minimize the cost of acquiring the necessary labour to produce the goods and services they sell. We have already seen in Unit 2 how firms might increase output without raising costs by adopting new technologies, and in Unit 7 we will study their sales decisions.
Hiring employees is different from buying other goods and services. When we buy a shirt or pay someone to mow a lawn, it is clear what we get for our cash. If we dont get it, we dont pay, but if we have already paid, we can go to court and get our money back.
But a firm cannot write an enforceable employment contract that specifies the exact tasks employees have to perform in order to get paid. This is for three reasons:

When the firm writes a contract for the employment of a worker, it cannot know exactly what it will need the employee to do, because this will be determined by unforeseen future events.
It would be impractical or too costly for the firm to observe exactly how much effort each employee makes in doing the job.
Even if the firm somehow acquired this information, it could not be the basis of an enforceable contract.

To understand the last point, consider a restaurant owner, who would like her staff to serve customers in a pleasant manner. Imagine how difficult it would be for a court to decide whether the owner can withhold wages from a waiter because he had not smiled often enough.

incomplete contractA contract that does not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of parties to the exchange (or of others).

An employment contract omits things that both the employees and the business owner care about: how hard and well the employee will work, and for how long the worker will stay. As a result of this contractual incompleteness, paying the lowest possible wage is almost never the firms strategy to minimize the cost of acquiring the labour effort it needs.

Exercise 6.2 Incomplete contracts
Think of two or three jobs with which you are familiar, perhaps a teacher, a retail worker, a nurse, or a police officer.
In each case, indicate why the employment contract is necessarily incomplete. What important parts of the persons jobthings that the employer would like to see the employee do or not docannot be covered in a contract, or if they are, cannot be enforced?


Great economists Karl Marx

Adam Smith, writing at the birth of capitalism in the eighteenth century, was to become its most famous advocate. Karl Marx (18181883), who watched capitalism mature in the industrial towns of England, was to become its most famous critic.
Born in Prussia (now part of Germany), he attended the local classical high school, which was celebrated for its ethos of enlightened liberalism. In 1842 he became a writer and editor for the Rheinische Zeitung, a liberal newspaper, which was then closed by the government, after which he moved to Paris and met Friedrich Engels, with whom he collaborated in writing The Communist Manifesto (1848). Marx then moved to London in 1849. At first, Marx and his wife Jenny lived in poverty. He earned money by writing about political events in Europe for the New York Tribune.
Marx saw capitalism as just the latest in a succession of economic arrangements in which people have lived since prehistory. Inequality was not unique to capitalism, he observedslavery, feudalism, and most other economic systems had shared this featurebut capitalism also generated perpetual change and growth in output.6
He was the first economist to understand why the capitalist economy was the most dynamic in human history. Perpetual change arose, Marx observed, because capitalists could survive only by introducing new technologies and products, finding ways of lowering costs, and by reinvesting their profits into businesses that would perpetually grow.
This, he claimed, inevitably caused conflict between employers and workers. Buying and selling goods in an open market is a transaction between equals: nobody is in a position to order anyone else to buy or sell. In the labour market, in which owners of capital are buyers and workers are the sellers, the appearance of freedom and equality was, to Marx, an illusion.
Employers did not buy the employees work, because this cannot be purchased, as we have seen in this unit. Instead, the wage allowed the employer to rent the worker and to command workers inside the firm. Workers were not inclined to disobey because they might lose their jobs and join the reserve army of the unemployed (the phrase that Marx used in his 1867 work, Capital). Marx thought that the power wielded by employers over workers was a core defect of capitalism.7

Capital is long and covers many subjects, but you can use a searchable archive to find the passages you need.

Marx also had influential views on history, politics, and sociology. He thought that history was decisively shaped by the interactions between scarcity, technological progress, and economic institutions, and that political conflicts arose from conflicts about the distribution of income and the organization of these institutions. He thought that capitalism, by organizing production and allocation in anonymous markets, created atomized individuals instead of integrated communities.
In recent years, economists have returned to themes in Marxs work to help explain economic crises. These themes include the firm as an arena of conflict and of the exercise of power (this unit), the role of technological progress (Unit 1 and Unit 2), and the problems created by inequality (Unit 19).


piece-rate workA type of employment in which the worker is paid a fixed amount for each unit of the product made.

Why is it not possible for firms just to pay employees according to how productive they are? For example, paying employees at a clothing factory $2for each garment they finish. This method of payment, known as piece rate, provides the employee with an incentive to exert effort, because employees take home more pay if they make more garments.
In the late nineteenth century the pay of more than half of US manufacturing workers was based on their output, but piece rates are not widely used in modern economies. At the turn of the twenty-first century less than 5% of manufacturing workers in the US were paid piece rates and, beyond the manufacturing sector, piece rates are used even less often.8
Why do most of todays firms not use this simple method to induce high effort from their employees?

It is very difficult to measure the amount of output an employee is producing in modern knowledge- and service-based economies (think about an office worker, or someone providing home care for an elderly person).
Employees rarely work alone, so measuring the contribution of individual workers is difficult (think about a team in a marketing company working on an advertising campaign, or the kitchen staff at a restaurant).

If piece rates are not practical, then what other method could a firm use to induce high effort from workers? How could the firm provide an incentive to do the job well, even though the worker is paid for time and not output? Just as the owners of the firm protect their interests by linking management pay to the firms share price, the manager uses incentives so that employees will work effectively.

Question 6.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following are reasons why employment contracts are incomplete?

The firm cannot contract an employee not to leave.
The firm cannot specify every eventuality in a contract.
The firm is unable to observe exactly how an employee is fulfilling the contract.
The contract is unfinished.


It may be costly for the firm if the employee leaves, but employees retain the right to do so.
Since the firm does not know all the tasks it will require of an employee, the contract is necessarily incomplete.
Since effort or the quality of an individuals work cannot be perfectly monitored and measured, it cannot be specified in the contract.
Employment contracts are usually long-term. An incomplete contract is not one that is unfinished, but rather one that does not completely specify every relevant aspect of the relationship.
