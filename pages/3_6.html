3.5 Decision making and scarcity
The final step in this decision-making process is to determine the combination of final grade and free time that Alexei will choose. Figure 3.10a brings together his feasible frontier (Figure 3.9) and indifference curves (Figure 3.6). Recall that the indifference curves indicate what Alexei prefers, and their slopes shows the trade-offs that he is willing to make; the feasible frontier is the constraint on his choice, and its slope shows the trade-off he is constrained to make.
Figure 3.10a shows four indifference curves, labelled IC1 to IC4. IC4 represents the highest level of utility because it is the furthest away from the origin. No combination of grade and free time on IC4 is feasible, however, because the whole indifference curve lies outside the feasible set. Suppose that Alexei considers choosing a combination somewhere in the feasible set, on IC1. By working through the steps in Figure 3.10a, you will see that he can increase his utility by moving to points on higher indifference curves until he reaches a feasible choice that maximizes his utility.

Which point will Alexei choose?


The diagram brings together Alexeis indifference curves and his feasible frontier.














Feasible combinations


On the indifference curve IC1, all combinations between A and B are feasible because they lie in the feasible set. Suppose Alexei chooses one of these points.














Could do better


All combinations in the lens-shaped area between IC1 and the feasible frontier are feasible, and give higher utility than combinations on IC1. For example, a movement to C would increase Alexeis utility.














Could do better


Moving from IC1 to point C on IC2 increases Alexeis utility. Switching from B to D would raise his utility by an equivalent amount.














The best feasible trade-off


But again, Alexei can raise his utility by moving into the lens-shaped area above IC2. He can continue to find feasible combinations on higher indifference curves, until he reaches E.














The best feasible trade-off


At E, he has 19 hours of free time per day and a grade of 57. Alexei maximizes his utility: he is on the highest indifference curve obtainable, given the feasible frontier.














MRS = MRT


At E the indifference curve is tangent to the feasible frontier. The marginal rate of substitution (the slope of the indifference curve) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation (the slope of the frontier).




Alexei maximizes his utility at point E, at which his indifference curve is tangent to the feasible frontier. The model predicts that Alexei will:

choose to spend 5 hours each day studying, and 19 hours on other activities
obtain a grade of 57 as a result

We can see from Figure 3.10a that at E, the feasible frontier and the highest attainable indifference curve IC3 are tangent to each other (they touch but do not cross). At E, the slope of the indifference curve is the same as the slope of the feasible frontier. Now, remember that the slopes represent the two trade-offs facing Alexei:

The slope of the indifference curve is the MRS: It is the trade-off he is willing to make between free time and percentage points.
The slope of the frontier is the MRT: It is the trade-off that he is constrained to make between free time and percentage points because it is not possible to go beyond the feasible frontier.

Alexei achieves the highest possible utility where the two trade-offs just balance (E). His optimal combination of grade and free time is at the point where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to the marginal rate of substitution.
Leibniz: Optimal allocation of free time: MRT meets MRS
Figure 3.10b shows the MRS (slope of indifference curve) and MRT (slope of feasible frontier) at the points shown in Figure 3.10a. At B and D, the number of points Alexei is willing to trade for an hour of free time (MRS) is greater than the opportunity cost of that hour (MRT), so he prefers to increase his free time. At A, the MRT is greater than the MRS so he prefers to decrease his free time. And, as expected, at E the MRS and MRT are equal.

constrained choice problemThis problem is about how we can do the best for ourselves, given our preferences and constraints, and when the things we value are scarce. See also: constrained optimization problem.

We have modelled the students decision on study hours as what we call a constrained choice problem: a decision-maker (Alexei) pursues an objective (utility maximization in this case) subject to a constraint (his feasible frontier).
In our example, both free time and points in the exam are scarce for Alexei because:


Free time and grades are goods: Alexei values both of them.


Each has an opportunity cost: More of one good means less of the other.


In constrained choice problems, the solution is the individuals optimal choice. If we assume that utility maximization is Alexeis goal, the optimal combination of grade and free time is a point on the feasible frontier at which:

The table in Figure 3.11 summarizes Alexeis trade-offs.

Exercise 3.6 Exploring scarcity
Describe a situation in which Alexeis grade points and free time would not be scarce. Remember, scarcity depends on both his preferences and the production function.


Question 3.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 3.10a shows Alexeis feasible frontier and his indifference curves for final grade and hours of free time per day. Suppose that all students have the same feasible frontier, but their indifference curves may differ in shape and slope depending on their preferences.
Use the diagram to decide which of the following is (are) correct.

Alexei will choose a point where the marginal rate of substitution equals the marginal rate of transformation.
C is below the feasible frontier but D is on the feasible frontier. Therefore, Alexei may select point D as his optimal choice.
All students with downward-sloping indifference curves, whatever the slope, would choose point E.
At E, Alexei has the highest ratio of final grade per hour of free time per day.


If Alexei were at a point on the feasible frontier where MRS  MRT, then he would be willing to give up more of one good than would actually be necessary to get some of the other. Therefore, he will choose to do so until he reaches a point where MRS = MRT.
Along the feasible frontier, Alexei would be on a higher indifference curve at E than at D. Therefore point D is not the optimal choice.
Students with flatter indifference curves (more willing to sacrifice more hours of free time for the same number of extra marks) have a lower marginal rate of substitution. Therefore, they will choose bundles to the left of E (such as D) where their indifference curves are tangent to the feasible frontier.
The points along the feasible frontier to the left of E have higher ratios of final grade per hour of free time, but are not optimal. The optimal point is where marginal rate of substitution equals marginal rate of transformation.
