12.5 Public goods

public goodA good for which use by one person does not reduce its availability to others. Also known as: non-rival good. See also: non-excludable public good, artificially scarce good.

The irrigation projects that we studied in Unit 4 are another example of a good that may not be provided efficiently in the market system. We described irrigation systems as a public good. When one farmer incurs a cost to provide irrigation, all farmers benefit. This creates a social dilemma. If farmers act independently, they all have an incentive to free-ride, in which case no one will provide irrigation. Only by finding ways of working together can they achieve the outcome that benefits them all.
The defining characteristic of a public good is that if it is available to one person it can be available to everyone at no additional cost. An irrigation system is a public good for the community where it is located. There are other examples that are public goods for a whole country, like national defence (if one person is protected from foreign invasion, this will be true of others, too) and weather forecasting (if I can tune in and find out if its likely to rain today, so can you). These are services that are typically provided by governments rather than the market.
Knowledge is also a public good. You can use your knowledge of a recipe for baking a cake or the rules of multiplication without affecting the ability of others to use the same knowledge. (This creates a problem for firms investing in researchif competing firms can freely appropriate the knowledge that they produce, their incentive to innovate is reduced.) And the environment provides public goods. Enjoying a view of the setting sun does not deprive anyone else of their enjoyment.
In all of these cases, once the good is available at all, the marginal cost of making it available to additional people is zero. Goods with this characteristic are also called non-rival goods.
A good is termed public if once available to one person, it can be available to everyone at no additional cost and its use by one person does not reduce its availability to others. This character of a public good is called non-rival because potential users are not in competition (rivals) with each other for the good.

non-excludable public goodA public good for which it is impossible to exclude anyone from having access. See also: artificially scarce good.

Note that some economists add that others cannot be excluded from the goods use. These goods are called non-excludable public goods. We consider the non-rival character of a public good to be its defining characteristic, whether others can be excluded or not.

copyrightOwnership rights over the use and distribution of an original work.

For some public goods, it is possible to exclude additional users, even though the cost of their use is zero. Examples are satellite TV, the information in a copyrighted book, or a film shown in an uncrowded cinema: it costs no more if an additional viewer is there, but the owner can nonetheless require that anyone who wants to see the film must pay. The same goes for a quiet road on which tollgates have been erected. Drivers can be excluded (unless they pay the toll) even though the marginal cost of an additional traveller is zero.

artificially scarce goodA public good that it is possible to exclude some people from enjoying. Also known as: club good.

Public goods for which it is feasible to exclude others are sometimes called artificially scarce goods or club goods (because they function like joining a private club: when the golf course is not crowded, adding one more member costs the golf club nothing, but the club will still charge a membership fee).

private goodA good that is both rival, and from which others can be excluded.

The opposite of a non-excludable public good is a private good. We have seen many examples: loaves of bread, dinners in restaurants, rupees divided between Anil and Bala (Unit 4), and boxes of breakfast cereal. All of these goods are both rival (more for Anil means less for Bala) and excludable (Anil can prevent Bala from taking his money).

common-pool resourceA rival good that one cannot prevent others from enjoying. Also known as: common property resource.

There is a fourth kind of good that is rival, but not excludable, called a common-pool resource. An example is fisheries that are open to all. What one fisherman catches cannot be caught by anyone else, but anyone who wants to fish can do so. We can also think of busy public roads as a common-pool resource. Anyone who chooses to use them may do so, but each user makes the road more congested and slows down the journeys of others. The table in Figure 12.8 summarizes the four kinds of goods.
Figure 12.8 shows four distinct categories of goods. But the extent of rivalry or excludability in goods is a matter of degree. For some kinds of goods, the cost of additional users is not literally zero (which is what pure non-rivalry would require) but instead very small. An example is a medical drug that cost millions in research funds to create the first pill, but only pennies per application to make treatments available to additional users once created.
Goods in economics are things that people want to use or consume. But there are also bads: things that people dont want, and might be willing to pay to not have, such as household refuse, or unpleasant-smelling drains. These are private bads. Analogously, we can define public bads: air pollution, for example, is a bad that affects many people simultaneously. It is non-rival in the sense that one person suffering its effects does not reduce the suffering of the others.







Rival
Non-rival




Excludable
Private goods (food, clothes, houses)
Public goods that are artificially scarce (subscription TV, uncongested tollroads, knowledge subject to intellectual property rights, Unit 21)


Non-excludable
Common-pool resources (fish stocks in a lake, common grazing land, Units 4 and 20)
Non-excludable public goods and bads (view of a lunar eclipse, public broadcasts, rules of arithmetic or calculus, national defence, noise and air pollution, Units 20 and 21)

As can be seen from the examples, whether a good is private or public depends not only on the nature of the good itself, but on legal and other institutions:

Knowledge that is not subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights would be classified as a non-excludable public good
 But when the author uses copyright law to create a monopoly on the right to reproduce that knowledge, it is a public good that is artificially scarce.
Common grazing land is a common-pool resource
 But if the same land is fenced to exclude other users, it becomes a private good.

Markets typically allocate private goods. But for the other three kinds of good, markets are either not possible or likely to fail. There are two reasons:

When goods are non-rival, the marginal cost is zero: Setting a price equal to marginal cost (as is necessary for a Pareto-efficient market transaction) will not be possible unless the provider is subsidized.
When goods are not excludable there is no way to charge a price for them: The provider cannot exclude people who havent paid.


patentA right of exclusive ownership of an idea or invention, which lasts for a specified length of time. During this time it effectively allows the owner to be a monopolist or exclusive user.

So when goods are not private, public policy may be required to allocate them. National defence is a responsibility of the government in all countries. Environmental policy addresses problems of common-pool resources and public bads such as pollution, and carbon emissions (see Unit 20). Governments also adopt a range of policies to address the problem of knowledge as a public good, such as issuing patents to give firms an incentive to undertake research and development (R&D) (see Unit 21).
Market failure in the case of public goods is closely related to the problems of external effects, absent property rights, and incomplete contracts that we have been discussing in this unit. A community irrigation system is a public good, so if one farmer decides to invest in an irrigation project, this confers an external benefit on the other farmers. Since her private benefit is less than the overall social benefit, she will invest too little from the point of view of the community, or she may not invest at all. There is no market in which the beneficiaries of the irrigation system pay the providers for the benefits they obtain, and it would be difficult to write complete contracts between all the farmers to achieve a Pareto-efficient irrigation level.

public badThe negative equivalent of a public good. It is non-rival in the sense that a given individuals consumption of the public bad does not diminish others consumption of it.

Similarly, we analysed Weevokil pollution as a problem in which the decisions of banana plantations imposed a negative external effect on fisherman. The private cost of using Weevokil was below the social cost, so the pesticide was overused. But we can also interpret the plantations as contributing to a public bad, from which all of the fishermen suffer.
The user of a common-pool resource imposes an external cost on other users. By driving your car on a busy road, for example, you contribute to the congestion experienced by other drivers.
Thus, any of the examples of non-private goods introduced in this section can be described using the framework we set up in Section 12.3 to summarize cases of market failure. They are summarized in the table in Figure 12.9.

Exercise 12.7 Rivalry and excludability
For each of the following goods or bads, decide whether they are rival and whether they are excludable, and explain your answer. If you think the answer depends on factors not specified here, explain how.

A free public lecture held at a university lecture theatre
Noise produced by aircraft around an international airport
A public park
A forest used by local people to collect firewood
Seats in a theatre to watch a musical
Bicycles available to the public to hire to travel around a city



Question 12.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

Some public goods are rival.
A public good must be non-excludable.
A good cannot be rival and non-excludable.
If a good is non-rival, then the cost of an additional person consuming it is zero.


Public goods are non-rival by definition.
For some public goods it is possible to exclude additional users even though the cost of use is zero, for example subscription TV. Such goods are called artificially scarce.
For example, common grazing land is rival but non-excludable. Such goods are called common-pool resources.
A good is non-rival if its use by one person does not reduce its availability to others, so it can be made available to another person without cost.
