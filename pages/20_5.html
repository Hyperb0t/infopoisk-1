20.4 Conflicts of interest: Bargaining over wages, pollution, and jobs
Conflicts of interest arise because environmental quality is never the same for everyone. Some people benefit or suffer more than others, depending on their location and income, as we saw in the banana pesticide case studied in Unit 12.
Here are two examples of how costs and benefits are not equally shared. In 2008 and 2009, two oil spills in the Niger River delta destroyed fisheries. The spills resulted from the oil extraction activities of the Anglo-Dutch company, Royal Dutch Shell. Lawyers for the Ogoni people, who suffered these external effects, brought a lawsuit against the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell in the British courts. In 2015, Shell settled out of court and paid 3,525 per person, of which 2,200 was paid to each individual, and the rest to support community public goods. This award amounted to more than most Ogoni people would earn in a year. Lawyers representing the community helped to set up bank accounts for the 15,600 beneficiaries.
The transfers may have compensated the Ogoni in part for the loss of a healthy environment, restoration of which the UN Environment Programme has estimated will cost $1 billion and take 30 years. For Royal Dutch Shell, the settlement at least partially internalizes the negative external effects of their activities, and might lead the companys owners (and others extracting oil in the delta) to consider a change in their behaviour.
In 1974 a giant lead, silver, and zinc smelter owned by the Bunker Hill Company was the only major employer in the town of Kellogg, in the American state of Idaho, employing 2,300 people. Many children in the town developed flu-like symptoms. Doctors discovered that they were the result of high lead levels in their bloodhigh enough to impair cognitive and social development of children.
Three of the children of Bill Yoss, a welder at the smelter, had been found to have dangerously high levels of lead poisoning. I dont know where well end up, he told a People reporter, We may pull out of the state.
The company refused to release its own tests of the smelters lead emission levels. Unless the states emissions regulations were relaxed, it said, the smelter would shut down, which it did, in 1981. Former employees looked for work elsewhere. The value of the homes and businesses in the town fell to a third of its earlier level. The local schools, which were supported by property taxes, did not have the funding to cope with those who remained.
We model this problem by considering a hypothetical town, Brownsville, with a single business that employs the entire labour force but whose toxic emissions are a threat to the health of the citizens. The firm can vary the level of emissions that it imposes on the town, but the costs of implementing emissions capture and storage means lost profits. The single owner of the firm (who bears the costs of reducing the level of emissions) lives far enough away that the level of emissions he selects does not affect the quality of his environment. Therefore citizens and the business will have a conflict of interest over the level of emissions in the town, and also over the wages paid. You can think of the citizens as valuing environmental quality, which decreases when emissions increase and can be measured by an air quality index.
The citizens of the town have some bargaining power because each is free to leave Brownsville and seek employment elsewhere. So the business must offer them a package of environmental quality and wages that is at least as desirable as their reservation option, which is what they might expect to receive if they left Brownsville. We call this limit on what the business must offer the citizens the leave town condition.
The business owner has bargaining power, too, because the wage and environment package that he offers must result in profits high enough that the firm does not simply shut down or relocate (we call this the firms shutdown condition). The citizens cannot demand more than this wage, or they would be unemployed (remember there are no other firms in Brownsville). Thus the firms reservation option places limits on the bargain that the citizens can strike with the firm.
We represent the relationship between the business and the citizens in Figure 20.15. The wage paid to the employees of the firm is on the horizontal axis. The level of environmental quality experienced by the citizens is on the vertical axis. We make the following assumptions:

Citizens are identical and so experience the same environmental quality.
The owner is unaffected by the level of pollution: For him, the environmental external effects resulting from his decision about emissions are borne by others. Pollution for him is a private good, and he does not consume any of it.

Work through the analysis in Figure 20.15 to see how the choices of the citizens and businesses are modelled.

The representative citizens reservation indifference curve is the leave town condition


This gives all the combinations of wages and environmental quality that would be just barely sufficient to induce a representative citizen to stay.














The firms shutdown condition


This shows the combinations of wages and environmental quality offered by the firm that would just barely keep the firm in Brownsville.














Infeasible options


The portions of the figure above the firms shutdown condition and below the citizens leave town condition are infeasible.














The citizens have power, point B


Suppose the citizens could impose a legally enforceable level of environmental quality in the town and set their own wages. Consistent with the firm remaining in town, the citizens set wages at w* and quality of the environment at Emax.














A take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, pointA


On the other hand, if the firm could announce a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, it would minimize costs whilst ensuring the citizens do not choose to leave town at Emin.














The difference between Emax and Emin


This is a measure of the extent of mutual gains the citizens and the business may enjoy. Any outcome in the shaded area is preferred by both parties to their outside option, but only the points between A and B, such as C, are Pareto efficient.




You may recall that this figure is very similar to Figure 5.8, in which Angela the farmer and Bruno the landowner were bargaining over the amount of grain Angela would transfer to Bruno. As in that problem, the study of a bargaining problem is easier if the slope of the indifference curves remains unchanged at a given wage as utility increases.
Here, the conflict is about the amount of emissions that the townspeople will suffer. The firms profits depend on the emissions, and profits are greater if it can dispose of more toxic materials freely.
The position of the citizens reservation indifference curve depends on what they would expect to get in some other location. If they could find a high-paying job in a non-toxic community, the curve would be higher and to the right of the one that is shown. Its slope, the marginal rate of substitution, is the citizens marginal utility of higher wages, divided by the marginal utility of environmental quality.

We assume that the citizens marginal valuation of improvements in the environment is constant, but (in contrast to the model in Section 20.3) they have diminishing marginal utility of receiving higher wages. At high wages (and very poor environmental quality) on the far right of the reservation indifference curve, the MRS is small (the curve is almost flat) because citizens would not care much about wages (as they are already getting paid a high wage) but they are very concerned about the poor environment. At low wages the curve is steep, because they place a high value on wage increases.
The firms shutdown condition shows the combinations of wages and environmental quality offered by the firm that would barely keep the firm in Brownsville. All of the points on this line have the same cost of producing a unit of output and, as a result, the same profit rate. The firms profits are increasing as you move towards the origin. It is like the isocost curve in Unit 2, and the isocost lines for effort in Unit 6.

The cost of raising the wage by $1 is $1. Assume the cost incurred by the owner if he reduces emissions is p per unit of abatement, so the owners MRS = 1/p. A steep line indicates that p is smallavoiding emissions and thereby allowing a healthier environment is cheap.
The firm faces a trade-off. If it is at point B in the figure, it pays wages and produces emissions at a level that makes it barely profitable enough to stay in business. Therefore, if it offers a higher-quality environment to the citizens, it can only do this by offering a lower wage. The opportunity cost of one unit of a better environment is p in reduced wages.
Any combination of wages and environmental quality in the shaded portion of the figure is a feasible outcome of this conflict. Any combination on the vertical line between A and B is a Pareto-efficient outcome. We cannot say which feasible outcome will occur, though, unless we know more about the bargaining power of the citizens and the firm.
The firm has all the bargaining power
If the firm could simply announce a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, then it would choose point A in Figure 20.15. The firms costs will then be well below the shutdown level of costs because they will be freely emitting toxic materials, which reduce the citizens environmental quality from Emax, the least emissions (and highest quality environment) consistent with the firm staying in business, to Emin. This difference (Emax  Emin) shows up as cost reductions, and hence as additional profits, in the firms accounts. It also shows up as exposure to health hazards in the medical records of the people who live in the town.
The firms chosen point, A, is on the citizens reservation indifference curve where the vertical distance between the firms shutdown condition and the citizens leave town condition is the greatest. This will occur when:

Citizens have all the bargaining power
If the bargaining power had been reversed, then the citizens would choose to impose Emax and wages w*. This ensures that the citizens are on their highest possible indifference curve, while also satisfying the firms shutdown condition. Again, at this point the MRS of the business is equal to the MRS of the citizens.
Dividing the mutual gains
The difference between Emax and Emin measures the extent of mutual gains the townspeople and the business may enjoy. Any outcome between A and B on the figure is preferable to the next best alternative for the business (shut down) and the citizens (leave town). You can think of the mutual gains as a pie that the citizens and the business owner will divide. How the pie is divided up between the two parties depends, as we have seen in Units 4 and 5, on their relative bargaining power.
A point such as C in Figure 20.15 might be possible if the citizens, acting jointly through their town council, imposed a legal minimal level of environmental quality and wages for the business to continue to operate. Acting together, the citizens would have more bargaining power than if they used the threat to leave town as individuals: they could require that the business at least meet the citizens shut-it-down condition shown in Figure 20.15.
Bargaining power in this case would be affected not only by the two parties reservation options but also by:

Enforcement capacity: The town government may not have enforcement capacities to impose an emissions limit on the firm.
Verifiable information: The citizens may not have sufficient information about the levels and dangers of emissions to win a case in court. If so, the firm would not comply with an agreed-upon emissions level such as at C in Figure 20.15.
Citizen consensus: If the towns citizens were not in agreement about the dangers of the emissions, the elected officials of the town who legislate an emissions limit might not be re-elected.
Lobbying: The firm may be able to convince the citizens that their health concerns were misplaced, or had little to do with the firms emissions.
Legal recourse: The firm may be legally entitled to emit any level of emissions that it finds profitable (perhaps subject to having purchased permits allowing it to do this).

So far we have focused on the question of how much abatement there should be. Now we consider a second question: How should the desired level of abatement be accomplished?

Question 20.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Consider a town with a single business that employs the entire labour force, whose toxic emissions are a threat to the health of the citizens. Figure 20.15 shows the business shutdown curve (the combination of wages and environmental quality offered by the firm that would just about keep the firm operating) and the citizens indifference curves for the quality of environment and their wage income. The citizens reservation indifference curve is also shown.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

All points below the citizens reservation indifference curve and above the business shutdown curve are infeasible.
If the business has all the bargaining power, then point B is chosen.
If the citizens have all the bargaining power, then they will choose the point with the highest possible wage.
Point C is the only Pareto-efficient choice.


True. At any of these points, at least one of the parties would prefer to take their outside option.
False. Point A would be chosen, because it is the point that maximizes profits while satisfying the citizens leave town condition.
False. Point B would be chosen, because it is the point that places citizens on their highest indifference curve while satisfying the firms shutdown condition. They strictly prefer B to the point where the shutdown curve intersects the horizontal axis, which is the highest feasible wage.
False. All points within the feasible set where the firm and citizens indifference curves are tangent are Pareto efficient (the line AB), including A, B, and C.
