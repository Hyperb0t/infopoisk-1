16.13 Conclusion
Unemployment is a market failure: it means that there are people willing to work at the current market wage but cannot find a willing employer. Job destruction is a constant feature of capitalist economies, in which technological changes tend to raise productivity and put some workers out of their jobs. But a well-functioning economy will also feature high levels of investment that ensure that jobs are created at least as fast as they are destroyed.
Ensuring that firms will invest both in technological progress and in job creation is one of the fundamental incentive problems of a capitalist economy. The other is ensuring that workers have the incentive to put in sufficient effort to do their jobs. We have analysed these incentives using the price-setting curve and the wage-setting curve, which show respectively the maximum wage that firms can pay and still remain in the industry, and the minimum wage that can be paid to get sufficient effort from workers.
The main difference between the high-performing economies and the laggards is that in high-performing economies, institutions and policies work so that the incentives of the main actors are to increase the size of the pie, rather than wasting resources fighting over the size of the slice.
