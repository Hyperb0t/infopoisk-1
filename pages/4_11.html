4.10 Dividing a pie (or leaving it on the table)
One of the most common tools to study social preferences is a two-person one-shot game known as the ultimatum game. It has been used around the world with experimental subjects including students, farmers, warehouse workers, and hunter-gatherers. By observing their choices we investigate the subjects preferences and motives, such as pure self-interest, altruism, inequality aversion, or reciprocity.
The subjects of the experiment are invited to play a game in which they will win some money. How much they win will depend on how they and the others in the game play. Real money is at stake in experimental games like these, otherwise we could not be sure the subjects answers to a hypothetical question would reflect their actions in real life.
The rules of the game are explained to the players. They are randomly matched in pairs, then one player is randomly assigned as the Proposer, and the other the Responder. The subjects do not know each other, but they know the other player was recruited to the experiment in the same way. Subjects remain anonymous.
The Proposer is provisionally given an amount of money, say $100, by the experimenter, and instructed to offer the Responder part of it. Any split is permitted, including keeping it all, or giving it all away. We will call this amount the pie because the point of the experiment is how it will be divided up.
The split takes the form: x for me, y for you where x + y = $100. The Responder
knows that the Proposer has $100 to split. After observing the offer, the Responder accepts or rejects it. If the offer is rejected, both individuals get nothing. If it is accepted, the split is implemented: the Proposer gets x and the Responder y. For example, if the Proposer offers $35 and the Responder accepts, the Proposer gets $65 and the Responder gets $35. If the Responder rejects the offer, they both get nothing.
This is called a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It is the ultimatum in the games name. The Responder is faced with a choice: accept $35, or get nothing.

economic rentA payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or reservation option). See also: reservation option.

This is a game about sharing the economic rents that arise in an interaction. An entrepreneur wanting to introduce a new technology could share the rentthe higher profit than is available from the current technologywith employees if they cooperate in its introduction. Here, the rent arises because the experimenter provisionally gives the Proposer the pie to divide. If the negotiation succeeds (the Responder accepts), both players receive a rent (a slice of the pie); their next best alternative is to get nothing (the pie is thrown away).
In the example above, if the Responder accepts the Proposers offer, then the Proposer gets a rent of $65, and the Responder gets $35. For the Responder there is a cost to saying no. He loses the rent that he would have received. Therefore $35 is the opportunity cost of rejecting the offer.
We start by thinking about a simplified case of the ultimatum game, represented in Figure 4.11 in a diagram called a game tree. The Proposers choices are either the fair offer of an equal split, or the unfair offer of 20 (keeping 80 for herself). Then the respondent has the choice to accept or reject. The payoffs are shown in the last row.

sequential gameA game in which all players do not choose their strategies at the same time, and players that choose later can see the strategies already chosen by the other players, for example the ultimatum game. See also: simultaneous game.

The game tree is a useful way to represent social interactions because it clarifies who does what, when they choose, and what are the results. We see that in the ultimatum game one player (the Proposer) chooses her strategy first, followed by the Responder. It is called a sequential game; previously we looked at simultaneous games, in which players chose strategies simultaneously.

simultaneous gameA game in which players choose strategies simultaneously, for example the prisoners dilemma. See also: sequential game.

What the Proposer will get depends on what the Responder does, so the Proposer has to think about the likely response of the other player. That is why this is called a strategic interaction. If youre the Proposer you cant try out a low offer to see what happens: you have only one chance to make an offer.
Put yourself in the place of the Responder in this game. Would you accept (50, 50)? Would you accept (80, 20)? Now switch roles. Suppose that you are the Proposer. What split would you offer to the Responder? Would your answer depend on whether the other person was a friend, a stranger, a person in need, or a competitor? A Responder who thinks that the Proposers offer has violated a social norm of fairness, or that the offer is insultingly low for some other reason, might be willing to sacrifice the payoff to punish the Proposer.
Now return to the general case, in which the Proposer can offer any amount between $0 and $100. If you were the Responder, what is the minimum amount you would be willing to accept? If you were the Proposer, what would you offer?

minimum acceptable offerIn the ultimatum game, the smallest offer by the Proposer that will not be rejected by the Responder. Generally applied in bargaining situations to mean the least favourable offer that would be accepted.

If you work through the Einstein below, and Exercise 4.7 that follows it, you will see how to work out the minimum acceptable offer, taking account of the social norm and of the individuals own attitude to reciprocity. The minimal acceptable offer is the offer at which the pleasure of getting the money is equal to the satisfaction the person would get from refusing the offer and getting no money, but being able to punish the Proposer for violating the social norm of 5050. If you are the Responder and your minimum acceptable offer is $35 (of the total pie of $100) then, if the Proposer offered you $36, you might not like the Proposer much, but you would still accept the offer instead of punishing the Proposer by rejecting the offer. If you rejected the offer, you would go home with satisfaction worth $35 and no money, when you could have had $36 in cash.

Einstein When will an offer in the ultimatum game be accepted?
Suppose $100 is to be split, and there is a fairness norm of 5050. When the proposal is $50 or above, (y  50), the Responder feels positively disposed towards the Proposer and would naturally accept the proposal, as rejecting it would hurt both herself and the Proposer whom she appreciates because they conform to, or were even more generous than, the social norm. But if the offer is below $50 then she feels that the 5050 norm is not being respected, and she may want to punish the Proposer for this breach. If she does reject the offer, this will come at a cost to her, because rejection means that both receive nothing.
Suppose the Responders anger at the breach of the social norm depends on the size of the breach: if the Proposer offers nothing she will be furious, but shes more likely to be puzzled than angry at an offer of $49.50 rather than the $50 offer she might have expected based on the social norm. So how much satisfaction she would derive from punishing a Proposers low offer depends on two things: her private reciprocity motive (R), and the gain from accepting the offer (y). R is a number that indicates the strength of the Responders private reciprocity motive: if R is a large number, then she cares a lot about whether the Proposer is acting generously and fairly or not, but if R = 0 she does not care about the Proposers motives at all. So the satisfaction at rejecting a low offer is R(50  y). The gain from accepting the offer is the offer itself, or y.
The decision to accept or reject just depends on which of these two quantities is larger. We can write this as reject an offer if y < R(50  y). This equation says that she will reject an offer of less than $50 according to how much lower than $50 the offer is (as measured by (50  y)), multiplied by her private attitude to reciprocity (R).
To calculate her minimum acceptable offer we can rearrange this rejection equation like this:

R = 1 means that the Responder places equal importance on reciprocity and the social norm. When R = 1, then y < 25 and she will reject any offer less than $25. The cutoff point of $25 is where her two motivations of monetary gain and punishing the Proposer exactly balance out: if she rejects the offer of $25, she loses $25 but receives $25 worth of satisfaction from punishing the Proposer so her total payoff is $0.
The more the Responder cares about reciprocity, the higher the Proposers offers have to be. For example, if R = 0.5, the Responder will reject offers below $16.67 (y < 16.67), but if R = 2, then the Responder will reject any offer less than $33.33.


Exercise 4.7 Acceptable offers

How might the minimum acceptable offer depend on the method by which the Proposer acquired the $100 (for example, did she find it on the street, win it in the lottery, receive it as an inheritance, and so on)?
Suppose that the fairness norm in this society is 5050. Can you imagine anyone offering more than 50% in such a society? If so, why?
