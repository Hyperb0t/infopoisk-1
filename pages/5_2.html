5.1 Institutions and power
Nowhere else in the world during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century did ordinary workers have the right to vote, to receive compensation for occupational injuries, or to be protected from the kinds of checks on arbitrary authority that were taken for granted on the Royal Rover. The Royal Rovers articles laid down in black and white the understandings among the pirates about their working conditions. They determined who did what aboard the ship and what each person would get. For example, the size of the helmsmans dividend compared to that of the gunner. There were also unwritten informal rules of appropriate behaviour that the pirates followed by custom, or to avoid condemnation by their crewmates.

Institutions
Institutions are written and unwritten rules that govern:

what people do when they interact in a joint project
the distribution of the products of their joint effort


These rules, both written and unwritten, were the institutions that governed the interactions among the crew members of the Royal Rover.

incentiveEconomic reward or punishment, which influences the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action.

The institutions provided both the constraints (no drinking after 8 p.m. unless on deck) and the incentives (the best pair of pistols for the lookout who spotted a ship that was later taken). In the terminology of game theory from the previous unit, we could say that they were the rules of the game, specifying, as in the ultimatum game in Section 4.10, who can do what, when they can do it, and how the players actions determine their payoffs.
In this unit, we use the terms institutions and rules of the game interchangeably.
Experiments in Unit 4 showed us that the rules of the game affect:

how the game is played
the size of the total payoff available to those participating
how this total is divided

For example, in the ultimatum game the rules (institutions) specify the size of the pie, who gets to be the Proposer, what the Proposer can do (offer any fraction of the pie), what the Responder can do (accept or refuse), and who gets what as a result.
We also saw that changing the rules of the game changes the outcome. In particular, when there are two Responders in the ultimatum game, they are more likely to accept lower offers because each is not sure what the other will do. And this means that the Proposer can make a lower offer, and obtain a higher payoff.
Since institutions determine who can do what, and how payoffs are distributed, they determine the power individuals have to get what they want in interactions with others.

Power
The ability to do and get the things we want in opposition to the intentions of others.

Power in economics takes two main forms:

It may set the terms of an exchange: By making a take-it-or-leave-it offer (as in the ultimatum game).
It may impose or threaten to impose heavy costs: Unless the other party acts in a way that benefits the person with power.


bargaining powerThe extent of a persons advantage in securing a larger share of the economic rents made possible by an interaction.

The rules of the ultimatum game determine the ability that the players have to obtain a high payoffthe extent of their advantage when dividing the piewhich is a form of power called bargaining power. The power to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer gives the Proposer more bargaining power than the Responder, and usually results in the Proposer getting more than half of the pie. Still, the Proposers bargaining power is limited because the Responder has the power to refuse. If there are two Responders, the power to refuse is weaker, so the Proposers bargaining power is increased.
In experiments the assignment of the role Proposer or Responder, and hence the assignment of bargaining power, is usually done by chance. In real economies, the assignment of power is definitely not random.
In the labour market, the power to set the terms of the exchange typically lies with those who own the factory or business: they are the ones proposing the wage and other terms of employment. Those seeking employment are like Responders, and since usually more than one person is applying for the same job, their bargaining power may be low, just as in the ultimatum game with more than one Responder. Also, because the place of employment is the employers private property, the employer may be able to exclude the worker by firing her unless her work is up to the specifications of the employer.
Remember from Units 1 and 2 that the productivity of labour started to increase in Britain around the middle of the seventeenth century. But it was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that a combination of shifts in the supply and demand for labour, and new institutions such as trade unions and the right to vote for workers, gave wage earners the bargaining power to raise wages substantially.
We will see in the next unit how the labour market, along with other institutions, gives both kinds of power to employers. In Unit 7 we explain how some firms have the power to set high prices for their products, and in Unit 10, how the credit market gives power to banks and other lenders over people seeking mortgages and loans.
The power to say no
Suppose we allow a Proposer simply to divide up a pie in any way, without any role for the Responder other than to take whatever he gets (if anything). Under these rules, the Proposer has all the bargaining power and the Responder none. There is an experimental game like this, and it is called (you guessed it) the dictator game.
There are many past and present examples of economic institutions that are like the dictator game, in which there is no option to say no. Examples include todays remaining political dictatorships, such as The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea), and slavery, as it existed in the US prior to the end of the American Civil War in 1865. Criminal organizations involved in drugs and human trafficking would be another modern example, in which power may take the form of physical coercion or threats of violence.
In a capitalist economy in a democratic society, institutions exist to protect people against violence and coercion, and to ensure that most economic interactions are conducted voluntarily. Later in this unit we study the outcome of an interaction involving coercion, and how it changes with the power to say no.
