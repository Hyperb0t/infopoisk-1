9.3 The wage-setting curve: Employment and real wages
We now build a model of the labour market that can help to explain differences in unemployment rates across countries, and changes over time within a country. To do this, we broaden the perspective from the single firm in Unit 6 to the whole economy, and we ask how changes in the unemployment rate affect the wage set by employers.
In Figure 9.4, the horizontal axis represents the proportion of the working-age population, and goes up to a value of 1. The vertical axis is the economy-wide wage.

The labour force is the vertical line furthest to the right: it has a value less than 1, depending on the participation rate.
Inactive workers are to the right of the labour force line.
The employment rate is the vertical line to the left of the labour force, indicating the share of the population who are actually working.
The unemployment rate is the proportion of those in the labour force who are not employed: that is, those workers in between the employment rate line and the labour force line.

The wage-setting curve


The upward-sloping line is called the wage-setting curve.














The profit-maximizing wage when unemployment is high


At 12% unemployment in the economy, the employees reservation wage is low and the worker will put in a high level of effort for a relatively low wage. The firms profit-maximizing wage is therefore low.














The profit-maximizing wage when unemployment is low


At 5% unemployment in the economy, the employees reservation wage is high and they will not put in much effort unless the wage is high. The firms profit-maximizing wage is therefore higher.





Nash equilibriumA set of strategies, one for each player in the game, such that each players strategy is a best response to the strategies chosen by everyone else.

The upward-sloping line is called the wage-setting curve. Like the best-effort response function of the employee on which it is based, the wage-setting curve is a mathematical version of an if-then statement: if the employment rate is x, then the Nash equilibrium wage will be w. This means that at the employment rate x, the wage w is the result of both employers and employees doing the best they can in setting wages and responding to the wage with a given amount of effort, respectively.
This statement is true because the wage-setting curve for the whole economy is based directly on the employers wage-setting decision and the employees effort decision in an economy that is composed of many firms like the one we modelled in Unit 6.
We show how to do this in Figure 9.5 by bringing together Figure 9.4 (the economy-wide wage-setting curve) and Figure 6.6 (how the firm sets the wage). The top panel of Figure 9.5 shows the employees best response curve at the two unemployment rates of 12% and 5%. As we saw in Unit 6, a higher unemployment rate reduces the reservation wage, because a worker faces a longer expected period of unemployment if he or she loses a job. This weakens the employees bargaining power and shifts the best response curve to the left. With an unemployment rate of 12%, the reservation wage is shown by point F. The employers profit-maximizing choice is point A with the low wage (wL).











Figure 9.5 
Deriving the wage-setting curve: Varying the unemployment rate in the economy.
        




In the lower panel, we plot point A. The dashed line from unemployment of 12% indicates that the wage is set at wL. We now assume a fixed size for the labour force and the horizontal axis gives the number of workers employed, N. As employment increases to the right, the unemployment ratefalls.
Using exactly the same reasoning, we find the profit-maximizing wage set when unemployment is much lower at 5%. Both the reservation wage and the wage set by the employer are higher, as shown by point B. This gives the second point on the wage-setting curve in the lower panel.
We derived the wage-setting curve as part of the labour discipline model, which was designed to illustrate how employees and firm owners (and their managers) interact when setting wages and determining the level of work effort. We will use the same model later when we describe policies to alter the level of unemployment in the entire economy. Later in this unit and in Units 16 and 17 we will look at the ways in which labour unions can affect the wage-setting process and so alter the workings of the labour market.

Wage-setting curves have been estimated for many economies. Read how it is done in an article by David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald.

Figure 9.6 is a wage-setting curve estimated from data for the US. Note that in Figure 9.6, the horizontal axis shows the unemployment rate explicitly, falling from left to right. By using data on unemployment rates and wages in local areas, economists can estimate and plot the wage-setting curve for an economy.

Simplifying the model
We can simplify the worker motivation problem and the wage curve by letting there be just two levels of effort:

working: providing the level of effort that the firms owners and managers have set as sufficient
shirking: providing no effort at all.

This will be useful later because it will allow us to take the level of effort as given with wages being set to ensure this.
In this case, the worker is represented as similar to a machine with just one speed, and it is either on or off. As shown in Figure 9.7, the wage curve is the boundary between two regions: on and above the wage curve are all the combinations of the real wage and employment level for which employees work, and below it the combinations for which employees shirk.

We will use this work or shirk simplification in the model from now on.

Exercise 9.2 Shifts in the wage-setting curve

Referring back to Unit 6, provide a brief explanation of the shift in the wage-setting curve for each row in the table below, using a diagram to show the best response function and the wage-setting curve. For the second and third rows, give an example from a real-world workplace.
Explain why a rise in the unemployment rate shifts the best response function but not the wage-setting curve.

Question 9.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 9.5 depicts the wage-setting curve and how it is derived using the best response function of the employees and the isocost lines for effort of the employers.












Based on this figure:

A cut in the unemployment benefit would shift the best response function to the left, and raise the wage-setting curve.
If the expected period of unemployment increased, it would shift the best response function to the right, raising the wage-setting curve.
In a country where the stigma attached to unemployment is high, the wage-setting curve would be lower.
A sudden drop in the working age population (due, for example, to the retirement of the baby-boomer generation) would shift the wage-setting curve lower.


A cut in the unemployment benefit would shift the best response function to the left. However that would mean that the equilibrium wage falls for a given unemployment rate, and lower the wage-setting curve.
An extended expected unemployment period would shift the best response function to the left, lowering the wage-setting curve.
If there is high stigma attached to unemployment, then the workers best response functions would move to the left. This reduces the equilibrium wage for a given unemployment rate, resulting in a lower wage-setting curve.
With the balance of job seekers and vacancies shifting in favour of the workers, their best response function would shift to the right, resulting in the wage-setting curve moving upwards.
