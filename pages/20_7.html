20.6 The measurement challenges of environmental policy
To implement environmental policies using the framework we have provided, we need to measure the value of abatement.
Placing a value on the benefits of abatement is challenging because we are dealing with missing markets for environmental quality and uncertain long-term impacts. What is the value of preserving a rainforest, saving a threatened species, creating better air, or less noise? To answer these questions, different methods are used depending on whether the environmental issue in question is affecting environmental wellbeing, health, consumption, or future assets.

hedonic pricingA method used to infer the economic value of unpriced environmental or perceptual qualities that affect the price of a marketed good. It allows a researcher to put a price on hard-to-quantify characteristics. Estimations are based on peoples revealed preferences, that is, the price they pay for one thing compared to another.contingent valuationA survey-based technique used to assess the value of non-market resources. Also known as: stated-preference model.

We examine two methods of measuring the benefits of abatement: hedonic pricing and contingent valuation.
Contingent valuation
Among the easiest and most widely used methods of valuing the benefits of abatement is simply to ask people. For example, after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, which released 11 million gallons (42 million litres) of crude oil into beautiful Prince William Sound, the court used contingent valuation to assess the value of the losses (such as the value of natural beauty) caused by the spill. They did this in a survey by asking respondents how much they would be willing to pay to prevent a new spill. The study estimated the lost value in 1990 to be at least $2.8 billion. Exxon eventually paid $1 billion in damages in a settlement with the governments of Alaska and the US.
Researchers used contingent valuation techniques to get a quantitative estimate of the value of elephant conservation in Sri Lanka. Farmers were killing elephants to protect crops and homes. The researchers wanted to know how much Sri Lankans would be willing to pay to the farmers as compensation for the damages caused by the elephants, if the farmers stopped killing them.2
Contingent evaluation is called a stated preference approach because it is survey-based and accepts the respondents statements of their values as indicative of their true preferences. This is not the case for hedonic pricing.
Hedonic pricing
Hedonic pricing is called a revealed preference approach because it uses peoples economic behaviour (not their statements) to reveal what their preferences are. Laboratory experiments are a similar method of studying revealed preferences, as we saw in Unit 4. But lab experiments are not very useful in valuing the environment.
For example, how much do you value having your residence being free of the sound of aircraft flying overhead? Economists observe that houses under aircraft flight paths are sold for less than equivalent houses in quieter locations. By comparing data on house prices, we can calculate the amount people are prepared to pay to avoid the noise pollution.
This technique was used in the UK to set the tax for landfill waste. The marginal benefits of abatement were estimated in a study that used data on more than half a million housing transactions over the period 19912000. By controlling for a large number of factors that can account for the variation in house prices, the researchers then tested whether any of the variation left unexplained could be accounted for by the proximity of the house to a landfill site. The researchers found that being within a quarter of a mile (400 metres) of a working landfill site reduced house prices by 7%. They calculated that the marginal benefit from reducing the proximity to a landfill site was 2.86 per tonne of waste (in 2003 prices).
Hedonic pricing and contingent valuation give us a way to measure the way people value a particular change in the environment given their experience of this change. Green growth accounting gives us a way to estimate the value of conserving environmental resources for society as a whole, today and in the future. Below, you will learn about how some economists are placing a monetary value on societys use of natural assets.

How economists learn from facts Natural capital and green growth

depreciationThe loss in value of a form of wealth that occurs either through use (wear and tear) or the passage of time (obsolescence).

Recall that depreciation refers to the wearing out or using up of the physical capital goods used in production. In the green growth accounting framework, the environment is similarly considered as an asset that can be used up. The environment is part of what society needs to produce goods and services. Thus, environmental degradation reduces the assets of the society in much the same way as the wear and tear or obsolescence of machines used in production.
Remember that income is the most a person, or a nation, could consume without reducing its capacity to produce in the future. This was the message of the bathtub in Unit 10. Income is the flow of water into the tub minus the amount of evaporation that is reducing the total amount of water in the tub. Income according to this definition is gross income minus depreciation.
Although environmental degradation is not measured in conventional national accounts, it should be, because using up our natural capital is no different from the wear and tear on the machines and other equipment we use.
The World Bank estimates that in low-income countries, natural capital comprises 47% of wealth, so using some of this up and not counting the loss overstates how fast income is really growing. By how much though? In order to take natural capital loss into account, we must figure out how much it will cost (per year) to replace the lost natural capital and then subtract it from the annual GDP figure (remember that the most common measure of income, GDP, does not even take account of the depreciation of capital goods because of difficulties with measurement).

green adjustmentAccounting adjustment made to conventional measures of national income to include the value of natural capital.

If you make this accounting adjustment (also known as a green adjustment), success stories of economic growth look less impressive. When Indonesian government policy generated a timber boom between 1979 and 1982, Robert Repetto and his colleagues from the World Resources Institute estimated that the country used up more than $2billion of potential forest revenues. They showed that, after considering deforestation, oil depletion, and soil erosion, Indonesias true average annual rate of growth of income (net of used up natural capital)originally reported as 7.1% from 1971 to 1984was in reality only 4%. A similar exercise was carried out for Sweden between 1993 and 1997, where the loss of natural assets was estimated to be around 1% of GDP per year.


When economists disagree Willingness to pay versus the right to a livable environment
The Constitution of the Republic South Africa asserts the citizens right to an environment which is not detrimental to his or her health or wellbeing. The Supreme Court of India ruled that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution of India includes the right to enjoyment of pollution-free water and air Similar rights are granted in at least 13 other constitutions, including those of Portugal, Turkey, Chile, and South Korea. Use the Constitute Project website to check the constitution of your country, or any other in which you are interested, to see if you can find these guarantees.
Political movements opposing the privatization of water supply have used similar language. Access to clean water, they argue, is a human right. When a feature of the environment such as proximity to a landfill, noise pollution, or toxic emissions from a smelter is valued in monetary terms using the methods described above, this ignores the principle advanced by many that people have a right to an environment free of these hazards.
But in response, others ask: why should the quality of the environment that you experience be any different from the quality of the car that you drive or the food that you eat? You get what you pay for, and if you are unwilling to pay, then why should the policymaker worry about your values? If you believe this, the benefits of abatement policies can be measured by the citizens willingness to pay (WTP) for the improved environment that the abatement will allow.
The WTP measure is criticized by some economists and citizens because it implies that people with hardly any money place a limited value on the environment, just as they have a limited willingness to pay for anything else. They do not lack the will, but they lack the way. Therefore using WTP as the method of estimating the benefits of abatementfor example, when either contingent valuation or hedonic pricing is usedmeans that policies that improve environmental hazards that mostly affect the poor, like ensuring safe drinking water in urban areas, will be valued less than policies that raise the environmental quality experienced by rich people, like pristine rivers, lakes, and oceans to enjoy while boating.
Also, this value may depend on how the question that determines the stated preference is asked. If, instead of our WTP for preservation of the environment, we are asked what compensation we are willing to accept (WTA) for the same proposed reduction in the quality of the same environment, empirical evidence is that the result would be a higher number.

merit goodsGoods and services that should be available to everyone, independently of their ability to pay.

If a safe environment is a right, an economist would term it a merit good, which you may recall from Unit 12. It is like the right to vote, or legal representation in court, or an adequate education: a good that should be available to all citizens irrespective of their ability to pay.
The advantage of the approach based on willingness to pay is that it makes use of information on how people value the environment. This should be relevant to how much we invest in environmental quality. Defining the environment as a right has the advantage that it does not give priority to the preferences of those with higher incomes in shaping environmental policy.


Exercise 20.8 Wealth and natural capital
Download the World Bank data in The Changing Wealth of Nations dataset.

Using the total wealth data, calculate the change in natural capital between 1995 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2005 in absolute terms for three high income, middle income, and low income countries. Summarize and interpret your results.

Go to the World Banks open data website. Find and download GDP (in constant prices) for your chosen countries for 1995, 2000, and 2005.

Calculate the change in GDP between these periods in absolute terms. Draw a scatter plot with the percentage change in GDP on the vertical axis and the percentage change in natural capital on the horizontal axis. Does it look like there is a relationship between these two variables? Suggest explanations for any relationship you find.



Question 20.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding valuation of the benefits of abatement?

An estimation of a nations GDP currently includes the depletion of the nations natural resources as a negative adjustment.
In the hedonic pricing method, the cost of noise pollution near an airport is estimated by a survey of how much the residents are willing to pay to reduce the noise.
In the contingent valuation method, the pollution due to landfill waste is estimated using the differences in the house prices according to the proximity to a landfill site.
Asking citizens for their willingness to pay for a greener environment may result in policies that mostly affect the poor being valued less than those that raise the environmental quality experienced by the rich.


False. GDP calculations typically do not include natural capital or physical capital depreciation.
False. This describes the contingent valuation methodology. Hedonic pricing would use observed behavior, such as the reduction in house prices near airports, to estimate the willingness to pay for noise reduction.
False. This describes the hedonic pricing methodology. Contingent valuation would use surveys to directly ask local residents how much they would pay to avoid living close to a landfill.
True. Since the marginal benefit of income is lower for the rich, they are generally willing to pay more for environmental goods. As a result, environmental goods that are largely of benefit to the rich may be valued highly using willingness to pay methodologies.
