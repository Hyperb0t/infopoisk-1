18.5 Specialization, factor endowments, and trade between countries
In this section, we look in more detail at trade specialization based on factor endowments, extending the analysis in Section 1.8. We show how trade between the people of different nationsspecialized in the production of different thingscan result in mutual gains, and also in conflicts over how these gains are distributed.

absolute advantageA person or country has this in the production of a good if the inputs it uses to produce this good are less than in some other person or country. See also: comparative advantage.

Imagine Greta lives on Wheat Island and Carlos lives on Apple Island. The land on each island can be used for growing both wheat and apples, and they consume both wheat and apples in order to survive. For the example in this section, we will use the numbers shown in Figure 18.15, and assume that Greta and Carlos each have the same amount of land. We have already seen that Greta is lucky. Wheat Island has better soil for both crops. She has an absolute advantage in both crops. Although Carlos land is worse overall for producing both crops, his disadvantage is less, relative to Greta, in apples than in wheat.







Production if 100% of time is spent on one good, per year




Greta
12,500 apples or 10,000 tonnes of wheat


Carlos
10,000 apples or 4,000 tonnes of wheat





Figure 18.15 
Absolute and comparative advantage in the production of apples and wheat.
        




Remember, even those who have an absolute advantage in nothing at all will specialize in the thing at which they are least bad, and get the other goods they consume by exchange. Similarly, people who are better at producing everything will specialize in the goods at which they are comparatively best, while importing other goods. Both Greta and Carlos can benefit from specialization and trade.
To see how this works, follow the analysis in Figure 18.16a.












Figure 18.16a 
Carlos (Apple Islands) and Gretas (Wheat Islands) feasible production frontiers.
        















Carlos production


The left-hand panel of the figure shows the combinations of wheat and apples that Carlos can produce in a year. If he produces only apples, he can produce 10,000 of them in a year. This is shown by point A on the horizontal axis.














Specialization in wheat


Similarly, if Carlos produces only wheat then he can produce 4,000 tonnes, as shown by point B on the vertical axis.














The feasible production frontier


The red line that joins points A and B is the feasible production frontier for Carlos. It shows all the combinations of wheat and apples that can be produced by Carlos in a year.














Carloss choice


He can choose to produce any combination on (or inside) the frontier. For example, he could produce 2,000 tonnes of wheat and 5,000 apples, as shown by point C.














Carlos feasible set


He can produce anywhere between the origin and the feasible production frontier. The red shaded area shows his feasible set.














The feasible production frontier for Greta


This is shown in the right hand panel. Greta can produce more of both goods than Carlos can. If she only produces a single good, she can produce either 12,500 apples or 10,000 tonnes of wheat in a year.














Wheat Island has an absolute advantage


It has this advantage in producing both goods because Greta can produce more of both of them. Graphically, Gretas feasible set includes Carlos within it.




Diversification in the absence of trade
In the absence of trade, Carlos and Greta do best by selecting a point on the highest indifference curve possible, given the constraint of their feasible production frontier. In our simple example, the feasible production frontier is also the feasible consumption frontier, because each person spends time producing only wheat and apples, and can consume only the amount they produce. Follow the analysis in Figure 18.16b to how Carlos and Greta make their production and consumption decisions.












Figure 18.16b 
Carlos (Apple Islands) and Gretas (Wheat Islands) utility-maximizing choices of consumption.
        















Carlos feasible consumption frontier


This is in the left-hand panel, coinciding with his feasible production frontier.














Carlos indifference curves


The shape of the indifference curves represents Carlos preferences over wheat and apples.














The highest indifference curve Carlos can attain


It will be the one that is tangent to his feasible consumption frontier. He will choose to consume 2,500 tonnes of wheat a year and 3,750 apples, as shown by point D.














Gretas superior productivity


This means she can consume more of both goods than Carlos. We assume her preferences are the same as Carlos (the indifference curves are the same shape). She consumes 6,000 tonnes of wheat a year and 5,000 apples, as shown by point E.




Trade and specialization
What will happen when Greta and Carlos are able to trade? The decision to trade could be made for a number of reasons, such as the development of a new technology (maybe a boat) or the removal of barriers to trade (perhaps the end of a feud between the two islands). As we learned in Unit 1, it is the relative, not the absolute, cost of producing the two goods that matters for mutually beneficial trade.
We will show that both Carlos and Greta gain when one island specializes in the production of wheat and the other specializes in the production of apples. Carlos can produce 4,000 tonnes of wheat a year, or 10,000 apples. In order to produce one more tonne of wheat, Carlos has to produce 2.5 fewer apples, so the marginal rate of transformation between tonnes of wheat and apples is 2.5. Since it takes the same amount of inputs (land and labour) to produce one tonne of wheat as it does to produce 2.5 apples, a tonne of wheat will cost the same as 2.5 apples. Thus the relative price of wheat to apples will be 2.5. The relative price is another way of referring to the marginal rate of transformation or the opportunity cost.
Greta is more productive in producing both goods. Greta can produce 10,000 tonnes of wheat in a year, or 12,500 apples. The relative price of wheat to apples on Wheat Island is therefore 1.25. Wheat Island therefore has a comparative advantage in producing wheat.
The relative price of apples is simply the inverse of the relative price of wheat, so if Wheat Island has a comparative advantage in producing wheat, then Apple Island will have a comparative advantage in producing apples. Figure 18.17 summarizes the key numbers from the example. The relative prices of the good for which each island has a comparative advantage are shown in bold.







Apple Island (Carlos)
Wheat Island (Greta)




Tonnes of wheat produced per year
4,000
10,000


Number of apples produced per year
10,000
12,500


Relative price of wheat
10,000/4,000 = 2.5
12,500/10,000 = 1.25


Relative price of apples
4,000/10,000 = 0.4
10,000/12,500 = 0.8





Figure 18.17 
An island has a comparative advantage in producing a good when it is relatively cheaper in their economy (in the absence of trade).
        




Gains from trade
When there is no trade (autarky, closed economies), the feasible production frontier is also the feasible consumption frontier. From Figure 18.16b, we can see that when the economies are closed, total production between the two countries is 2,500 + 6,000 = 8,500 tonnes of wheat and 3,750 + 5,000 = 8,750 apples. When countries fully specialize however, Greta is able to produce 10,000 tonnes of wheat and Carlos can produce 10,000 apples, so there is more of both goods overall. As long as they can trade, they can both consume more of each good and can, ideally, both be better off.
If we assume that there are no trade costs, it is obvious that the relative price of wheat and apples is the same in each country when they trade. What will the new price be? From Carlos point of view, the supply of wheat has increased more than the supply of apples, so the price of wheat relative to apples will go down to something less than 2.5. Equally, from Gretas point of view the supply of wheat has increased by less than the supply of apples, so the relative price of wheat will go up for her to something higher than 1.25. When trading, the prices will lie between the prices experienced by the two economies when they are closed.
To see what happens when they trade, work through the analysis in Figure 18.18.












Figure 18.18 
The effect of trade and specialization on Carlos and Gretas feasible consumption frontiers.
        















Before specialization and trade


The figure shows the feasible production frontiers for Carlos and Greta.














The effect of specialization and trade


The dotted red lines show the outward shift of the feasible consumption frontiers due to specialization and trade. We assume that the relative price of wheat after specialization and trade is 2 (an arbitrary price in between 1.25 and 2.5).














Consumption after specialization and trade


Carlos specializes in apples, producing 10,000, and exports (10,000  6,000 = 4,000) apples to Greta, who specializes in wheat, producing 10,000 tonnes and exports (10,000  8,000 = 2,000) tonnes of wheat to Carlos.




Because both countries are now specializing in the good in which they have a comparative advantage, the new consumption frontiers are above their production frontiers. For each country, the two frontiers meet at the point at which they do not trade, which given full specialization, correspond to each axis. We can see that specialization and international trade have led to an increase in the size of the feasible consumption set for both countries. Note that through trade, Greta cannot consume more than the maximum amount of apples Carlos can produce (10,000), which is why her feasible consumption frontier does not extend beyond 10,000 apples.
If we look back to Figure 18.16b we can see that any expansion of their feasible sets makes it possible for both Carlos and Greta to reach a higher level of utility (a higher indifference curve), so trade has been mutually beneficial.
Specialization has enlarged the feasible consumption set of both in the same way that borrowing and investing increased the feasible consumption set of Marco in Unit 10. By investing, Marco specialized in having income in the future, which increased the total income he earned over all periods. Then, by borrowing, he imported some of his future income to the present so that he could consume in both periods.
The relative price determines the extent to which trade increases the feasible set of each island. This, in turn, depends on how the price is determined. Suppose that Greta can unilaterally determine the price. To increase her gains from trade, Greta will choose a price that increases the amount of apples she receives for each tonne of wheat she sells to Carlos. Intuitively, Greta wants the good she produces to command a higher price. If we assume that she has chosen a price of wheat of 2.25, then how does this affect the expansion of the feasible sets? Follow the analysis in Figure 18.19 to find out.












Figure 18.19 
The effect of trade and specialization on the feasible consumption frontiers for Carlos and Greta, when Greta is able to dictate the price.
        















Feasible production frontiers


The figure starts with the same feasible production frontiers as Figure 18.18.














After trade


Greta now dictates the relative price of wheat to be 2.25. Trade still shifts out both feasible sets, but it shifts Gretas by more. This means trade and specialization will increase the utility of both Carlos and Greta, but will increase Gretas utility by more.














At the new price


Greta has to give up fewer tonnes of wheat to get 4,000 apples. She is better off than she was at a price of 2 in Figure 18.18. In contrast, Carlos is worse off relative to the price of 2. He gets fewer tonnes of wheat in return for the same number of apples.





bargaining powerThe extent of a persons advantage in securing a larger share of the economic rents made possible by an interaction.

Of course, if Greta could set any price she wished, she could have set an even higher price. If she set the price at 2.5 apples per tonne, she would eliminate Carlos gains from trade entirely. At this price Carlos would be equally well off if he produced his own wheat and would have no reason to engage in trade with Greta. When the people of a country are better able to influence the price in their favour, we say they have bargaining power.

Great economists David Ricardo

David Ricardo (17721823) developed the theory of comparative advantage. He was also the first economist to warn that a rapidly growing capitalist economy would confront the limits of its natural environment.
The son of a successful stockbroker and the third of 17 children, Ricardo grew up in London and eloped at the age of 21, which led to a long period of estrangement from his parents. He went on to build a huge fortune through trading in stocks before interesting himself in political economy. He entered parliament (by purchasing a seat, which then was possible) where, besides his contributions on economic questions, he favoured liberal social causes such as religious tolerance, freedom of speech, and opposition to slavery.1
Ricardos central contribution to economic theory was an analysis of the principles of production and distribution in a growing capitalist economy with a large agrarian sector. In An Essay on Profits, published in 1815, he developed the Ricardian model, which came to dominate British economic thought for much of the next 50 years. In this model, agricultural production relied on three inputs: labour, capital, and land. As production and population expanded, either existing land had to be farmed more intensively with greater doses of capital and labour, or less fertile plots had to be brought into production.
Drawing on ideas of diminishing returns, he explained how this would lead to a squeeze on profits and the eventual stagnation of the economy. Like Thomas Malthus, whose ideas we studied in Unit 2, he reasoned that wages could not be below subsistence. As farming expanded to less good land, the price of food and hence wages would have to increase. A result would be that profits (which Ricardo presumed would be invested) would fall. Rents (presumed to be spent on luxuries) would increase due to the growing scarcity of land. The result would be the eventual slowdown and stagnation of the economy.
Ricardo therefore advocated a repeal of tariffs on the import of grains (known as the Corn Laws), which his friend Malthus defended. Ricardo reasoned that if Britain could acquire more of its food from the US and elsewhere, then paying workers a subsistence wage would cost less to the employers, raising the rate of profit and investment. Importing grain rather than growing it in Britain would make land less scarce and therefore limit the landlords share of total output. The result, according to Ricardo, would be continued growth rather than stagnation.2
His greatest work, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (published in 1817), introduced the labour theory of value, later used by Karl Marx. This theory holds that the value of goods is proportional to the amount of labour required, directly or indirectly, in their production. Wassily Leontief (19061999) devised a way that these values could be calculated (see When economists disagree: HeckscherOhlin, and the Leontief Paradox later in this unit).
In Principles, Ricardo laid out the principle of comparative advantage, recognizing that two countries could trade to the mutual advantage of each, even if one of them was absolutely better at producing all goods.
Ricardo is not as famous an economist as Smith, Malthus, Mill, or Marx, but he is greatly respected for the theory of comparative advantage. In addition, his method of structuring thought using an abstract model as a guide to economic understanding makes him a very modern great economist.


Exercise 18.5 Comparative advantage
Suppose that there are only two countries in the world, Germany and Turkey, each with four workers. Within a given time period, each worker in Germany can produce three cars or two televisions, and each worker in Turkey can produce two cars or three televisions.

Draw the feasible production frontier for each country, with televisions on the horizontal axis and cars on the vertical axis. In the absence of trade, what is the relative price of cars in each country?
Suppose that, in the absence of trade, Germany consumes nine cars and two televisions while Turkey consumes two cars and nine televisions. Mark these consumption points as G and T, respectively. Draw the feasible consumption frontier for each country in the absence of trade. Comment on the relationship between the production and consumption frontiers you have drawn for each country.
Now suppose Germany and Turkey start trading. What is the range of possible values for the world relative price of cars? If the world relative price of cars is PC/PTV = 1, in which good will each country specialize?
Now use the world relative price given above to draw the feasible consumption frontier of each country in the figures you have drawn. Use these figures to explain whether or not each country gains from trade.
What is the marginal rate of transformation between cars and televisions in each country? Explain the relationship between comparative advantage and the
 marginal rate of transformation between goods.



Exercise 18.6 Power and bargaining
Going back to our example of Carlos and Greta, assume that Greta has the power to set the relative price. Based on what you have learned in Unit 4 about how people play the ultimatum game, how do you think Carlos would react to a price offer of 2.4 apples per tonne of wheat?


Question 18.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram shows Carlos and Gretas feasible production frontiers and their utility-maximizing choices of consumption between wheat and apples under autarky (no trade).












Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

Carlos will choose to consume 10,000 apples.
Greta can consume 3,750 apples and 2,500 tonnes of wheat but will choose not to do so.
Greta has an absolute advantage in the production of wheat, while Carlos has an absolute advantage in the production of apples.
Regardless of the shape of the indifference curves (which could be different from those depicted in the diagram), Greta will always choose to consume more of both goods than Carlos.


Carlos will choose point D where he consumes 3,750 apples and 2,500 tonnes of wheat.
This combination of goods lies within the feasible consumption frontier for Greta, but she is able to consume more of both good so would never choose this bundle.
Greta has the absolute advantage in the production of both goods.
It is entirely possible that with different shapes of indifference curves that Greta will choose to consume less of one of the goods than Carlos. For example, if her indifference curves were shallower (closer to being horizontal), she would consume fewer apples.



Question 18.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.18 depicts the feasible frontier and the consumption frontier of Carlos and Greta if they specialize and trade. The resulting relative price of wheat is assumed to be 2.
Let the resulting consumption be at A and B, respectively, for Greta and Carlos. Then which of the following statements is correct?

As Greta has the absolute advantage in production of both goods, she will produce both apples and wheat.
Carlos produces 6,000 apples and 2,000 tonnes of wheat, while Greta produces 4,000 apples and 8,000 tonnes of wheat.
Carlos trades 4,000 of his apples for 2,000 tonnes of Gretas wheat.
Greta is better off while Carlos is worse off as a result of the trade.


The point is that they both specialize in the good with comparative advantage and trade. Therefore Carlos produces all the apples while Greta produces all the wheat.
Those are their consumption choices as a result of trade. The two specialize and produce just one of the goods each.
Given each person is fully specializing, to calculate the amount of each good that is traded we just need to look at their consumption of the goods that they do not produce themselves. These goods must have been traded.
As a result of the trade they are both able to achieve a point on a higher indifference curve. Therefore they both benefit from the trade.



Question 18.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram shows Alexs and Joses feasible production frontiers for oranges and melons.












Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?

Jose has an absolute advantage in the production of both melons and oranges.
Jose has a comparative advantage in the production of melons.
With trade and specialization, Jose will specialize in the production of oranges while Alex will specialize in the production of melons.
The relative price of melons after trade will be 1.75.


Joses feasible production set includes Alexs within it, so he has absolute advantage in both goods.
Jose can produce twice as many oranges as melons. On the other hand, Alex can produce 1.5 times as many oranges as melons. Therefore Jose has the comparative advantage in the production of oranges.
Visually comparing the slopes of the feasible production frontiers, we see that Jose has a comparative advantage in oranges and Alex in melons.
The relative price after trade will depend on the bargaining power of the two, which may or may not be 1.75.
