1.7 Capitalism as an economic system
Figure 1.8 shows that the three parts of the definition of a capitalist economic system are nested concepts. The left-hand circle describes an economy of isolated families who own their capital goods and the goods they produce, but have little or no exchange with others.

Capitalism: Private property, markets and firms.
        




In a capitalist system, production takes place in firms. Markets and private property are essential parts of how firms function for two reasons:

Inputs and outputs are private property: The firms buildings, equipment, patents, and other inputs into production, as well as the resulting outputs, belong to the owners.
Firms use markets to sell outputs: The owners profits depend on markets in which customers may willingly purchase the products at a price that will more than cover production costs.8

Historically, economies like the left-hand circle have existed, but have been much less important than a system in which markets and private property are combined (the middle circle). Private property is an essential condition for the operation of markets: buyers will not want to pay for goods unless they can have the right to own them. In the middle circle most production is done either by individuals (shoemakers or blacksmiths, for example) or in families (for example, on a farm). Prior to 1600 a great many of the economies of the world were like this.

ownershipThe right to use and exclude others from the use of something, and the right to sell the thing that is owned.

A distinctive aspect of the definition of capitalism as an economic system is that under it most production takes place using privately owned capital goods that are operated by workers who are paid wages. This contrasts with government ownership of capital goods in a centrally planned economy, where private firms and markets are relatively unimportant.
Another contrast is with an economic system defined as a slave economy, where most of the work is done by people who are not hired for wages but, instead, like the land on which they work, are the property of another person. Going beyond these definitions, capitalist economic systems also include work done by government officials and unpaid work in the home, and, historically, by slaves.
Capitalism is an economic system that combines centralization with decentralization. It concentrates power in the hands of owners and managers of firms who are then able to secure the cooperation of large numbers of employees in the production process. But it limits the powers of owners and of other individuals, because they face competition to buy and sell in markets.
So when the owner of a firm interacts with an employee, he or she is the boss. But when the same owner interacts with a potential customer he or she is simply another person trying to make a sale, in competition with other firms. It is this unusual combination of competition among firms, and concentration of power and cooperation within them, that accounts for capitalisms success as an economic system.
How could capitalism lead to growth in living standards?
Two major changes accompanied the emergence of capitalism, both of which enhanced the productivity of individual workers:
Technology
As we have seen, the permanent technological revolution coincided with the transition to firms as the predominant means of organizing production. This does not mean that firms necessarily caused technological change. But firms competing with each other in markets had strong incentives to adopt and develop new and more productive technologies, and to invest in capital goods that would have been beyond the reach of small-scale family enterprises.
Specialization
The growth of firms employing large numbers of workersand the expansion of markets linking the entire world in a process of exchangeallowed historically unprecedented specialization in the tasks and products on which people worked. In the next section, we will see how this specialization can raise labour productivity and living standards.

Exercise 1.9 Firm or not?
Using our definition, explain whether each of the following entities is a firm by investigating if it satisfies the characteristics that define a firm. Research the entity online if you are stuck.
