10.11 The central banks policy rate can affect spending
Households and firms borrow to spend: the more it costs to borrow (equivalently, the higher the interest rate), the less they spend now. This allows the central bank to influence the amount of spending in the economy, which then affects firms decisions about how many people to employ and what prices to set. In this way, the central bank can affect the level of unemployment and inflation (rising prices), as we shall see in detail in Units 13 to 15.
To see the effect of a lower interest rate on consumption spending, we return to Julia, who has no wealth, but expects to receive $100 one year from now. Use the analysis in Figure 10.18 to see how the interest rate affects her decision over how much to spend now.












Figure 10.18 
Interest rates and consumption spending.
        















Julia has no wealth now


She expects to receive $100 in one year.














The moneylenders interest rate


At the moneylenders interest rate of 78%, she borrowed in order to spend $35 now (point G).














A lower interest rate


At the interest rate of 10% she would borrow and spend $58 now (point E).














As the interest rate falls


The right-hand panel of the figure traces out Julias consumption spending now as the interest rate falls, with G and E corresponding to the same points in the left-hand panel.














Julias demand curve


The downward-sloping line is Julias demand for loans, which also shows her expenditure now.




In many rich countries, when people borrow it is most often to purchase a car or a home (mortgages for housing are less common in countries where financial markets are less developed). Loans for this purpose are readily available even to people of limited wealth because, unlike loans to purchase food or daily consumption items, mortgage loans purchase a car or house that can be signed over to the bank as collateral. This insures the bank against default risk. For this reason, an important channel for the effects of the interest rate on domestic spending in many rich economies is through its effect on home purchases and consumer durables such as automobiles. The interest rates set by central banks can help to moderate ups and downs in spending on housing and consumer durables, and so smooth out the fluctuations in the whole economy.

Question 10.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram depicts Julias choice of consumptions in periods 1 (now) and 2 (later) under different interest rates. She has no income in period 1 but an income in period 2 against which she can borrow. Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?













A cut in the interest rate increases the marginal rate of transformation of consumption from period 2 to period 1.
Julia will unambiguously increase her consumption in period 1 after an interest rate cut.
Julia will unambiguously decrease her consumption in period 2 after an interest rate cut.
The graph of interest rate (vertical axis) versus period-1 consumption (horizontal axis) is downward sloping.


The marginal rate of transformation is one plus the interest rate. Hence it decreases with an interest rate cut.
The interest rate cut increases Julias income and also makes present consumption cheaper relative to future consumption, so both the income and substitution effects lead her to increase consumption in period 1.
The substitution effect of the rate cut will lead Julia to decrease her consumption in period 2. The income effect of the rate cut will lead her to increase her consumption in period 2. The net effect is therefore ambiguous.
We can see from Figure 10.18 that consumption in period 1 increases as the interest rate goes down, so consumption in period 1 is decreasing in the interest rate, meaning that the graph is downward sloping.



Exercise 10.6 Interest rates and consumption spending
Think about the income and substitution effects of a rise in the interest rate, as analysed in Exercise 10.2 and 10.3. Comment on whether a rise in the interest rate would be expected to reduce consumption expenditure in an economy in which a proportion of households are like Julia, and a proportion are like Marco.
