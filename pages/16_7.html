16.6 Technological change and income inequality

short run (model)The term does not refer to a period of time, but instead to what is exogenous: prices, wages, the capital stock, technology, institutions.

A long-run cost curve, for example, refers to costs when the firm can fully adjust all of the inputs including its capital goods; but technology and the economys institutions are exogenous. See also: technology, institutions, short run (model), medium run (model).

What happens to the distribution of income in an economy when a new technology is introduced that raises the productivity of labour? Think about the case we just studied in Figures 16.9a and 16.9b, where we highlight the contrast between the short-run immediate impact, and the long-run outcome that results once the higher profits, made possible by the innovation, have motivated additional investments by firm owners.
In the short run, the economy moves from point A to point D in Figure 16.9b. The new technology raises output per worker and reduces the number of people employed. For those employed at D, we assume that in the short run the real wage is unaffected.
What is the effect on inequality in the short run, at point D? Inequality increases for two reasons: first, because of the rise in the number of unemployed workers with low or no income, and second because in the short run only the employers reap the benefit of the new technology. The employers share of output goes up. This is summarized in the first row of Figure 16.10. Of course, had wages at D fallen to meet the wage-setting curve at the new unemployment rate, this would have exacerbated the rise in inequality.
But this is not where the process ends. Point D in Figure 16.9b is not a Nash equilibrium because at the new level of productivity and the old real wage, firms are making sufficient profits to either attract new firms to enter or to incentivize existing firms to expand their output. Looking back to Figure 16.9b, the economy expands and more people are employed. This also pushes wages up along the wage-setting curve. This process will continue until the wage is sufficiently high that firms stop expanding or entering the economy, that is until the economy reaches point B, the new Nash equilibrium.

Comparing the new Nash equilibrium at point B with the initial one at point A, both workers and employers benefit from the new technology. The wage share is back at its initial level and inequality is lower at B because the unemployment rate is lower. Note that although the wage share at B is no higher than at A, real wages are higher.
The long-run effect of the change in technology was to slightly reduce inequality because:

the share of output going to employees was restored to its pre-existing level in the long run due to an increase in real wages
the higher real wage allowed employers to maintain motivation for workers to work hard at a lower level of unemployment

To see the effect on inequality, we will represent the initial situation by a Lorenz curve (introduced in Unit 5 and used also in Units 9 and 10), and then see how its shape changes. In Figure 16.11, the unemployed, workers, and employers are shown on the horizontal axis.
The solid line in Figure 16.11 is the Lorenz curve corresponding to the situation at point A in Figure 16.9b. When unemployment increases to D (on the horizontal axis), the Lorenz curve shifts out to the dashed one. The kink is lower, reflecting the lower wage share at point D. In the long run, unemployment falls to B and the wage share returns to its initial level. The Lorenz curve shifts inwards.
Follow the steps in the analysis in Figure 16.11 to see how the Lorenz curve changes on the way to the new equilibrium.

Unemployment before a new technology is introduced


The economy starts in long-run equilibrium before the new technology, with a share A of the population being unemployed (corresponding to point A in Figure 16.9b).














The implementation of the new technology


This displaces some workers from their jobs so that unemployment now increases to D (corresponding to point D in Figure 16.9b). We assume that wages remain the same for the remaining workers, so since output per worker has risen, wages as a share of output declines.














Economic profits are high


New firms will be attracted to the economy and investment will rise, so existing firms will expand. Unemployment eventually falls to the level shown by point B, the new long-run equilibrium.





Exercise 16.5 Technological progress and inequality
The Einstein in Unit 9 showed that the Gini coefficient g can be calculated from the three groups of people in the economy-wide labour market as follows:

Here, u represents the fraction unemployed, n the fraction of the labour force in employment, the quantity 1  n  u the fraction of the labour force that are employers, w the real wage, and  the output per worker. The expression w/ is the fraction of total output that workers wages can purchase, called the wage share. This is clear because wn is total wages paid, and n is total output produced.
In the initial Lorenz curve (prior to the technical change), suppose there were 6 unemployed, 84 employed workers and 10 employers, with wages sufficient to purchase 60% of output.

Confirm that the Gini coefficient in this case would be 0.336.
Now suppose that technological progress leads to 4 workers losing their jobs while output stays constant, and the wage level of the remaining workers also stays constant, so profits increase by the amount that the total wage bill has dropped. What is the new wage share? What is the new Gini coefficient?
In the long run, assume there are 4 unemployed, 86 employed, and 10 employers, and the wage share returns to 60%. What is the Gini coefficient now? In your own words, explain why inequality increased in the short run and fell in the long run.



Question 16.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Does the introduction of a new labour-saving technology result in?

Higher wage share of output and higher Gini coefficient in the short run.
Lower wage share of output and higher Gini coefficient in the short run.
Lower wage share of output and lower Gini coefficient in the short run.
Higher unemployment, lower wage share of output, and higher Gini coefficient in the long run.


The labour-saving technology leads to higher unemployment while the wage and total output are constant. This means that the profit share of output is higher, and the wage share is lower. The Gini coefficient is higher.
The increase in unemployment lowers total wages and hence the wage share in the economy.
Higher unemployment with constant wages and total output lowers the wage share of output but increases the Gini coefficient.
In the long run, improvements in technology result in job creation too, leading to lower unemployment. The wage share remains constant because the markup is constant, and the Gini coefficient is lower.
