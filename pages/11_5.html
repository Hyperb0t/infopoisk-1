11.4 Prices, rent-seeking, and market dynamics at work: Oil prices
Figure 11.7 plots the real price of oil in world markets (in constant 2014 US dollars) and the total quantity consumed globally from 1865 to 2014. To understand what drives the large fluctuations in the oil price, we can use our supply and demand model, distinguishing between the short run and the long run.

We know that prices reflect scarcity. If a good becomes scarcer, or more costly to produce, the supply will fall and price will tend to rise. For more than 60 years, oil industry analysts have been predicting that demand would soon outstrip supply: production would reach a peak and prices would then rise as world reserves declined. Peak oil is not evident in Figure 11.7. One reason is that rising prices provide incentives for further exploration. Between 1981 and 2014, more than 1,000 billion barrels were extracted and consumed, yet world reserves of oil more than doubled from roughly 680 billion barrels to 1,700 billion barrels.
Prices have risen strongly in the twenty-first century and an increasing number of analysts are predicting that conventional oil, at least, has reached a peak. But unconventional resources such as shale oil are now being exploited. Perhaps it will be climate change policies, rather than resource depletion, that eventually curb oil consumption.34
What makes the price messages in Figure 11.7 hard to read is the sharp swings from high to low and back again over short periods of time. These fluctuations cannot be explained by looking at oil reserves, because they reflect short-run scarcity. Both supply and demand are inelastic in the shortrun.
Short-run supply and demand
On the demand side, the main use of oil products is in transport services (air, road, and sea). Demand is inelastic in the short run because of the limited substitution possibilities. For example, even if petrol prices rise substantially, in the short run most commuters will continue to use their existing cars to travel to work because of the limited alternatives immediately available to them. So the short-run demand curve is steep.
Traditional oil extraction technology is characterized by a large up-front investment in expensive oil wells that can take many months or longer to construct, and once in place, can keep pumping until the well is depleted or oil can no longer be profitably extracted. Once the well is drilled, the cost of extracting the oil is relatively low, but the rate at which the oil is pumped faces capacity constraintsproducers can get only so many barrels per day from a well. This means that, taking existing capacity as fixed in the short run, we should draw a short-run supply curve that is initially low and flat, and then turns upwards very steeply as capacity constraints are hit. We also need to allow for the oligopolistic structure of the world market for crude oil. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a cartel with a dozen member countries that currently accounts for about 40% of world oil production. OPEC sets output quotas for its members. We can represent this in our supply and demand diagram by a flat marginal cost line that stops at the total OPEC production quota. At that point, the line becomes vertical. This is not because of capacity constraints, but because OPEC producers will not sell any more oil.

oligopolyA market with a small number of sellers, giving each seller some market power.

Figure 11.8 assembles the market supply curve by adding the OPEC production quota to the non-OPEC supply curves (remember we obtain market supply curves by adding the amounts supplied by each producer at each price) and combines it with the demand curve to determine the world oil price.

OPEC supply


OPECs members can increase production easily within their current capacity, without increasing their marginal cost c. OPEC quotas limit their total production to QOPEC.














The non-OPEC supply


Non-OPEC countries can produce oil at the same marginal cost c until they get close to capacity, when their marginal costs rise steeply.














World supply curve


Total world supply is the sum of production by OPEC and other countries at each price.














The equilibrium oil price


The demand curve is steep: world demand is inelastic in the short run. In equilibrium, the price is P0 and total oil consumption Q0 is equal to QOPEC + Qnon-OPEC.














Profit


OPECs profit is (P0  c)  QOPEC, the area of the rectangle below P0. Non-OPEC profit is the rest of the shaded area below P0.




The 1970s oil price shocks
In 1973 and 1974, OPEC countries imposed a partial oil embargo in response to the 19734 Middle East war, and in 1979 and 1980, oil production by Iran and Iraq fell because of the supply disruptions following the Iranian Revolution and the outbreak of the IranIraq war. These are represented in Figure 11.9 by a leftward shift of the world supply curve Sworld, driven by a reduction in the volume of OPEC production to QOPEC. Total production and consumption falls, but because demand is very price-inelastic, the percentage increase in price is much larger than the percentage decrease in quantity. This is what we see in the data in Figure 11.7. The oil price (in 2014 US dollars) goes from $18 per barrel in 1973 to $56 in 1974, and then to $106 in 1980, but the declines in world oil consumption after these price shocks are small by comparison (2% between 1973 and 1975, and 10% between 1979 and 1983).

The 20002008 oil price shock

income elasticity of demandThe percentage change in demand that would occur in response to a 1% increase in the individuals income.

The years 2000 to 2008 were a period of rapid economic growth in industrializing countries, especially China and India. The income elasticity of demand for oil and oil products is higher in these countries than in developed market economies, and demand for car ownership and tourist air travel is growing relatively rapidly as they become wealthier. This increase in income moves the demand curve to the right, as shown in Figure 11.10. In this case, it is the inelastic short-run supply curve for oil that accounts for the big increase in price and only a modest increase in world oil consumption. The sharp price decrease in 2009 has the same explanation but in reverse: the financial crisis of 20089 was a negative demand shock that moved the demand curve to the left, so world consumption fell by about 3%, and the price of crude fell from over $100 per barrel in the summer of 2008 to $4050 in early 2009.

Exercise 11.3 The world market for oil
Using the supply and demand diagram:

Illustrate what happens when economic growth boosts world demand
      
in the short run
in the long run as producers invest in new oil wells
in the long run as consumers find substitutes for oil


Similarly, describe the short and long-run consequences of a negative supply shock similar to the 1970s shock.
If you observed an oil price rise, how in principle could you tell whether it was driven by supply-side or demand-side developments?
How would the diagram, and the response to shocks, be different if there were:
      
a competitive market composed of many producers?
a single monopoly oil producer?
an OPEC cartel controlling 100% of world oil production and seeking to maximize the combined profits of its members?


Why would individual OPEC member countries have an incentive to produce more than the quota assigned to them?
Does this logic carry over to the situation in the real world where there are also non-OPEC producers?



Exercise 11.4 The shale oil revolution
An important development in the past 10 years has been the re-emergence of the US as a major oil producer via the shale oil revolution. Shale oil is extracted using the technology of hydraulic fracturing or fracking: injecting fluid into ground at high pressure to fracture the rock and allow extraction. In a speech called The New Economics of Oil in October 2015, Spencer Dale, group chief economist at oil producer BP plc, explained how shale oil production differs from traditional extraction.

According to Dale, how has the shale oil revolution affected the world market for oil?
How will the world oil market be different in future?
Explain how our supply and demand diagram should be changed if his analysis is correct.
