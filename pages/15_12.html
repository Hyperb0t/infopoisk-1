15.11 Macroeconomic policy before the global financial crisis: Inflation-targeting policy

great moderationPeriod of low volatility in aggregate output in advanced economies between the 1980s and the 2008 financial crisis. The name was suggested by James Stock and Mark Watson, the economists, and popularized by Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve.

The 25 years before the global financial crisis in 2008 came to be known as the great moderation. A look back at Figure 15.12 tells us why. Despite a major oil shock in the 2000s, the British economy and many other economies continued to experience steady growth, low inflation and low unemployment. This is a remarkable contrast with the high inflation and high unemployment of the 1970s.
There were two important features of the 1990s and 2000s prior to the crisis:

inflation targetingMonetary policy regime where the central bank changes interest rates to influence aggregate demand in order to keep the economy close to an inflation target, which is normally specified by the government.


Central banks were made independent of government control: Monetary policy was placed in the hands of these independent central banks in most advanced and many developing countries.
Inflation targeting: These banks used their policy instruments to keep the economy close to a target rate of inflation. As shown in Figure 15.19, by 2012, 28 countries had adopted inflation targeting, usually with a band (range) of what was judged an acceptable level of inflation.

Why make central banks independent and give them inflation targets? The lessons of Figure 15.6 about the instability of Phillips curves, and the high costs of unemployment incurred by countries in the 1980s as they brought inflation down, created the impetus. Policymakers globally believed there would be an inflation-stabilizing unemployment rate.
Beginning in the 1990s, governments increasingly took the view that central banks should be given responsibility for keeping the economy close to a target rate of inflation. This is typically around 2% in developed economies, but higher in some developing economies, as the table in Figure 15.19 shows. Since many voters will prefer lower unemployment even if it comes with higher inflation, as we saw in Section 15.1, how can central banks credibly commit not to deviate from their announced inflation target?

To tackle this concern, many countries increased the independence of the central bank. Politicians, like the West German superminister Helmut Schmidt, may want to promise lower unemployment noweven if this leads to rising inflation laterto be re-elected. Making the central bank independent, with an explicit inflation target, makes it easier for the central bank to resist political pressure. This prevents a wage-price spiral. The central bank is committed to act to keep inflation close to the target and this, in turn, is expected to help keep the inflation rate expected by workers and firms close to target.
Figure 15.20 illustrates the relationship between the degree of central bank independence in the mid-1980s, and average inflation between 1962 and 1990, across OECD countries. There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables. Countries with little central bank independence in the mid-1980s were those where inflation was, on average, higher over the 30-year period.

We cant conclude from this correlation how, or even if, central bank independence limited inflation, but many suspected that central bank independence would make it easier to control inflation. As a result, the high-inflation countries granted much more independence to their central bank, with a low inflation target embedded in official statutes.
New Zealand, which had high inflation in 1989, pioneered inflation targeting. Inflation fell and remained low. Other high-inflation countries soon followed, in particular Mediterranean countries like Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy, and France.
This evidence suggests that central bank independence does help to reduce inflation.
Under the policy of inflation targeting, whenever the economy was experiencing lower unemployment than the inflation-stabilizing rate (moving to the northeast on a Phillips curve and on to a less favourable indifference curve), the central bank would raise the interest rate and dampen aggregate demand. Similarly, following a fall in aggregate demand (as a result of a fall in business confidence, for example) and facing the threat of recession, the central bank would cut the interest rate and bring the economy back toward its inflation target. We described the actions of the Federal Reserve in these terms in Figure 15.17.
Figure 15.21 shows the Phillips curve and indifference curves for an economy with an inflation-targeting central bank. The economy has stable inflation at point X, where inflation is at the policymakers 2% target and unemployment at labour market equilibrium is 6%. Labour market equilibrium, and hence the inflation-stabilizing rate of unemployment, will be different in different countries. For example, during the 2000s, it was estimated at 5.9% in the UK, and 7.7% in Germany.

If an aggregate demand shock reduces unemployment below 6%, inflation rises along the Phillips curve. In response, the central bank would raise the interest rate to reduce aggregate demand and raise unemployment. Unless the central bank acts promptly, a wage-price spiral can begin, with the Phillips curve shifting upward. Likewise, if inflation should fall below target, the central bank will lower the interest rate to put upward pressure on inflation.
The commitment of central banks to an inflation target helps explain why the third oil shock in the 2000s did not provoke a return to the high inflation of the 1970s. The commitment meant that even if the inflation rate rose temporarily, no one expected it to last because the central bank was committed to preventing it. With stable inflation expectations, there was no reason for a wage-price spiral to begin.

Question 15.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 15.21 depicts the Phillips curve and the indifference curves of an economy. This economy has an independent central bank with an inflation target of 2%.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The central bank will try to achieve zero unemployment while keeping the inflation at 2%.
The shape of the indifference curves indicates that the central bank is willing to trade higher inflation for lower unemployment at all times.
Consider an aggregate demand shock that increases unemployment. Without monetary or fiscal policy to counter the negative bargaining gap, the Phillips curve would shift down.
Consider an aggregate demand shock that increases unemployment. The central bank would raise the interest rate to put downward pressure on inflation, in order to bring it back to the target rate.


The Phillips curve shows that this is not achievable. This reflects the fact that there is always positive unemployment in the labour market model. The central bank will try to achieve the inflation-stabilizing unemployment rate of 6%, as this is the labour market equilibrium.
This is true in the upward-sloping parts of the indifference curves. Where the indifference curves are downward sloping (for example, when unemployment is higher than 6% and the inflation is lower than 2%), it would choose to trade higher inflation for higher unemployment.
The negative bargaining gap would lead to lower inflation, which would lead to lower inflation expectations next period, which would shift the Phillips curve down.
An aggregate demand shock that increases unemployment will reduce inflation along the Phillips curve. Therefore the central bank should lower interest rate to put upward pressure on inflation, in order to bring it back up to the target rate.
