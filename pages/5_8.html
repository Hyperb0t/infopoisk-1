5.7 Economically feasible allocations and the surplus
We check back on Angela and Bruno, and immediately notice that Bruno is now wearing a suit, and is no longer armed. He explains that this is no longer needed because there is now a government with laws administered by courts, and professional enforcers called the police. Bruno now owns the land, and Angela must have permission to use his property. He can offer a contract allowing her to farm the land, and give him part of the harvest in return. But the law requires that exchange is voluntary: Angela can refuse the offer.

Bruno
It used to be a matter of power, but now both Angela and I have property rights: I own the land, and she owns her own labour. The new rules of the game mean that I can no longer force Angela to work. She has to agree to the allocation that I propose.
You
And if she doesnt?
Bruno
Then there is no deal. She doesnt work on my land, I get nothing, and she gets barely enough to survive from the government.
You
So you and Angela have the same amount of power?
Bruno
Certainly not! I am the one who gets to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I am like the Proposer in the ultimatum game, except that this is no game. If she refuses she goes hungry.
You
But if she refuses you get zero?
Bruno
That will never happen.

Why does he know this? Bruno knows that Angela, unlike the subjects in the ultimatum game experiments, is entirely self-interested (she does not punish an unfair offer). If he makes an offer that is just a tiny bit better for Angela than not working at all and getting subsistence rations, she will accept it.
Now he asks you a question similar to the one he asked earlier:

Bruno
In this case, what should my take-it-or-leave-it offer be?

You answered before by showing him the biological survival constraint. Now the limitation is not Angelas survival, but rather her agreement. You know that she values her free time, so the more hours he offers her to work, the more he is going to have to pay.

You
Why dont you just look at Angelas indifference curve that passes through the point where she does not work at all and barely survives? That will tell you how much is the least you can pay her for each of the hours of free time she would give up to work for you.


reservation optionA persons next best alternative among all options in a particular transaction. Also known as: fallback option. See also: reservation price.reservation indifference curveA curve that indicates allocations (combinations) that are as highly valued as ones reservation option.

Point Z in Figure 5.6 is the allocation in which Angela does no work and gets only survival rations (from the government, or perhaps her family). This is her reservation option: if she refuses Brunos offer, she has this option as a backup. Follow the steps in Figure 5.6 to see Angelas reservation indifference curve: all of the allocations that have the same value for her as the reservation option. Below or to the left of the curve she is worse off than in her reservation option. Above and to the right she is better off.

Angelas reservation option


Point Z, the allocation in which Angela does not work and gets only survival rations from the government, is called her reservation option.














Angelas reservation indifference curve


The curve showing all of the allocations that are just as highly valued by Angela as the reservation option is called her reservation indifference curve.














The economically feasible set


The points in the area bounded by the reservation indifference curve and the feasible frontier (including the points on the frontiers) define the set of all economically feasible allocations.




The set of points bounded by the reservation indifference curve and the feasible frontier is the set of all economically feasible allocations, now that Angela has to agree to the proposal that Bruno makes. Bruno thanks you for this handy new tool for figuring out the most he can get from Angela.
The biological survival constraint and the reservation indifference curve have a common point (Z): at that point, Angela does no work and gets subsistence rations from the government. Other than that, the two curves differ. The reservation indifference curve is uniformly above the biological survival constraint. The reason, you explain to Bruno, is that however hard she works along the survival constraint, she barely survives; and the more she works the less free time she has, so the unhappier she is. Along the reservation indifference curve, by contrast, she is just as well off as at her reservation option, meaning that being able to keep more of the grain that she produces compensates exactly for her lost free time.

Exercise 5.6 Biological and economic feasibility
Using Figure 5.6:

Explain why a point on the biological survival constraint is higher (more grain is required) when Angela has fewer hours of free time. Why does the curve also get steeper when she works more?
Explain why the biologically feasible set is not equal to the economically feasible set.
Explain (by shifting the curves) what happens if a more nutritious kind of grain is available for Angela to grow and consume.


We can see that both Angela and Bruno may benefit if a deal can be made. Their exchangeallowing her to use his land (that is, not using his property right to exclude her) in return for her sharing some of what she producesmakes it possible for both to be better off than if no deal had been struck.

As long as Bruno gets some of the crop he will do better than if there is no deal.
As long as Angelas share makes her better off than she would have been if she took her reservation option, taking account of her work hours, she will also benefit.

This potential for mutual gain is why their exchange need not take place at the point of a gun, but can be motivated by the desire of both to be better off.

Pareto improvementA change that benefits at least one person without making anyone else worse off. See also: Pareto dominant.

All of the allocations that represent mutual gains are shown in the economically feasible set in Figure 5.6. Each of these allocations Pareto dominates the allocation that would occur without a deal. In other words, Bruno and Angela could achieve a Pareto improvement.
This does not mean that both parties will benefit equally. If the institutions in effect give Bruno the power to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer, subject only to Angelas agreement, he can capture the entire surplus (minus the tiny bit necessary to get Angela to agree). Bruno knows this already.
Once you have explained the reservation indifference curve to him, Bruno knows which allocation he wants. He maximizes the amount of grain he can get at the maximum height of the lens-shaped region between Angelas reservation indifference curve and the feasible frontier. This will be where the MRT on the feasible frontier is equal to the MRS on the indifference curve. Figure 5.7a shows that this allocation requires Angela to work for fewer hours than she did under coercion.












Figure 5.7a 
Brunos take-it-or-leave-it proposal when Angela can refuse.
        















Brunos best outcome using coercion


Using coercion, Bruno chose allocation B. He forced Angela to work 11 hours and received grain equal to AB. The MRT at A is equal to the MRS at B on Angelas biological survival constraint.














When Angela can say no


With voluntary exchange, allocation B is not available. The best that Bruno can do is allocation D, where Angela works for 8 hours, giving him grain equal to CD.














MRS = MRT again


When Angela works 8 hours, the MRT isequal to the MRS on Angelas reservation indifference curve, as shown by the slopes.




So Bruno would like Angela to work for 8 hours and give him 4.5bushels of grain (allocation D). How can he implement this allocation? All he has to do is to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer of a contract allowing Angela to work the land, in return for a land rent of 4.5 bushels per day. If Angela has to pay 4.5 bushels (CD in Figure 5.7a) then she will choose to produce at point C, where she works for 8 hours. You can see this in the figure; if she produced at any other point on the feasible frontier and then gave Bruno 4.5 bushels, she would have lower utilityshe would be below her reservation indifference curve. But she can achieve her reservation utility by working for 8 hours, so she will accept the contract.

Exercise 5.7 Why Angela works for 8 hours
Angelas income is the amount she produces minus the land rent she pays to Bruno.

Using Figure 5.7a, suppose Angela works 11 hours. Would her income (after paying land rent) be greater or less than when she works 8 hours? Suppose instead, she works 6 hours, how would her income compare with when she works 8 hours?
Explain in your own words why she will choose to work 8 hours.


Since Angela is on her reservation indifference curve, only Bruno benefits from this exchange. All of the joint surplus goes to Bruno. His economic rent (equal to the land rent she pays him) is the surplus.
Remember that when Angela could work the land on her own she chose allocation C. Notice now that she chooses the same hours of work when she has to pay rent. Why does this happen? However much rent Angela has to pay, she will choose her hours of work to maximize her utility, so she will produce at a point on the feasible frontier where the MRT is equal to her MRS. And we know that her preferences are such that her MRS doesnt change with the amount of grain she consumes, so it will not be affected by the rent. This means that if she can choose her hours, she will work for 8hours irrespective of the land rent (as long as this gives her at least her reservation utility).
Leibniz: Angelas choice of working hours when she pays rent
Figure 5.7b shows how the surplus (which Bruno gets) varies with Angelas hours. You will see that the surplus falls as Angela works more or less than 8 hours. It is hump-shaped, like Brunos rent in the case of coercion. But the peak is lower when Bruno needs Angela to agree to the proposal.












Brunos take-it-or-leave-it proposal when Angela can refuse.

Angelas working hours when she was coerced


Using coercion, Angela was forced to work 11 hours. The MRT was equal to the MRS on Angelas biological survival constraint.














Brunos best take-it-or-leave-it offer


When Bruno cannot force Angela to work, he should offer a contract in which Angela pays him 4.5 bushels to rent the land. She works for 8 hours, where the MRT is equal to the MRS on her reservation indifference curve.














The maximum surplus


If Angela works more or less than 8hours, the joint surplus is less than 4.5bushels.














Brunos grain


Although Bruno cannot coerce Angela he can get the whole surplus.














Technically and economically feasible peaks compared


The peak of the hump is lower when Angela can refuse, compared to when Bruno could order her to work.





Exercise 5.8 Take it or leave it?

Why is it Bruno, and not Angela, who has the power to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer?
Can you imagine a situation in which the farmer, not the landowner, might have this power?



Question 5.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.6 shows Angela and Brunos feasible frontier, Angelas biological survival constraint, and her reservation indifference curve.
Based on this figure, which of the following is correct?

The economically feasible set is the same as the technically feasible set.
For any given number of hours of free time, the marginal rate of substitution on the reservation indifference curve is smaller than that on the biological survival constraint.
Some points are economically feasible but not technically feasible.
If the ration Angela gets from the government increases from 2 to 3 bushels of grain, her reservation indifference curve will be above her biological survival constraint whatever her working hours.


The economically feasible set is the area between the reservation indifference curve and the feasible frontier. This is smaller than the technically feasible set, which is the area between the biological survival constraint and the feasible frontier.
The reservation indifference curve is steeper than the biological survival constraint, in other words the MRS is larger on the former than on the latter.
A point cannot be economically feasible if it is not technically feasible. The figure shows that the economically feasible set lies inside the technically feasible set.
When the ration is 2 bushels, Angelas reservation option is Z = (24, 2). If it increases to 3 bushels, her reservation option is (24, 3), which is on a higher indifference curve that lies above the survival constraint at all points. This will now be her reservation indifference curve.



Question 5.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.7a shows Angela and Brunos feasible frontier, Angelas biological survival constraint and her reservation indifference curve. B is the outcome under coercion, while D is the outcome under voluntary exchange when Bruno makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
Looking at this graph, we can conclude that:

With a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Brunos economic rent is equal to the joint surplus.
Both Bruno and Angela are better off under voluntary exchange than under coercion.
When Bruno makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Angela accepts because she receives an economic rent.
Angela works longer under voluntary exchange than under coercion.


Brunos reservation option is to receive nothing. Under voluntary exchange, Bruno receives the whole of the surplus: the amount in excess of what Angela needs to either survive or be willing to work. So this is his economic rent.
Brunos amount of grain is the distance AB under coercion, and CD under voluntary exchange. So he is better off under coercion.
Bruno offers an allocation Angela is only just willing to accept. She is indifferent between D and her reservation option, so her rent is zero.
Angela will have more hours of free time at D under voluntary exchange than under coercion.
