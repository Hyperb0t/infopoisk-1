11.8 Modelling bubbles and crashes
We have seen that bubbles could occur in markets for financial assets because demand depends, in part, on expectations about the prices at which they may be resold in future. This argument might also apply to durable goodssuch as houses, paintings, and collectibles like vintage cars or stamps. Can we apply our model of price-taking buyers and sellers to such markets?
Figure 11.15 illustrates the supply and demand for shares in a (so far) hypothetical firm called the Flying Car Corporation (FCC). Initially the share price is $50 on the lowest demand curve. When potential traders and investors receive good news about expected future profitability, the demand curve shifts to the right, and the price increases to $60 (for simplicity, we assume that the supply curve doesnt move).
Initially the exogenous rise in demand has the same effect as in the markets for bread and hats. Follow the steps in Figure 11.15 to see what happens next.

The initial price


Initially the price of a share in a firm called the Flying Car Corporation (FCC) is $50 on the lowest demand curve.














The response to good news


When potential traders and investors receive good news about expected future profitability, the demand curve shifts to the right, and the price increases to $60.














The effect of a price rise


Observing the price rise, potential buyers treat it as further good news. The demand curve shifts up simply because the price has increased, and the price rises again to $70.














The beginning of a bubble


This further rise may lead to another shift in demand, continuing the process.





positive feedback (process)A process whereby some initial change sets in motion a process that magnifies the initial change. See also: negative feedback (process).

The sequence of events in Figure 11.15 can happen if individuals interpret a price rise to mean that other people have received news that they hadnt heard themselves, and adjust their own expectations upwards. Or they may think there is an opportunity for speculation: to buy the stock now and sell to other buyers at a profit later. Either way, the initial increase in demand creates a positive feedback, leading to further increases in demand.
This does not happen in the bread market. People do not respond to a rise in bread price by buying more bread and filling their freezer. To model markets for assets like shares, paintings, or houses, we need to allow for the additional effects of beliefs about future prices. Figure 11.16 contrasts two alternative scenarios following an exogenous shock of good news about future profits of FCC that raises the price from $50 to $60 as in Figure11.15.
In the left-hand panel, beliefs dampen price rises: some market participants respond to the initial price rise with scepticism about whether the fundamental value of FCC is really $60, so they sell shares, taking a profit from the higher price. This behaviour reduces the price and it falls to a value somewhat above its initial level, where it stabilizes. The news has been incorporated into a price between $50 and $60, reflecting the aggregate of beliefs in the market about the new fundamental value of FCC.

Positive vs negative feedback.
        




By contrast, in the right panel beliefs amplify price rises. When demand rises, others believe that the initial rise in price signals a further rise in future. These beliefs produce an increase in the demand for FCC shares. Other traders see that those who bought more shares in FCC benefited as its price rose and so they follow suit. A self-reinforcing cycle of higher prices and rising demand takes hold.

stable equilibriumAn equilibrium in which there is a tendency for the equilibrium to be restored after it is disturbed by a small shock.

If beliefs dampen price changes and restore the market to equilibrium after a price shock, we say that the equilibrium is stable. Figure 11.17 shows how we can model the process of price adjustment in the case of a stable equilibrium. The left-hand panel shows supply and demand curves for FCC shares, with an equilibrium price P0 corresponding to their fundamental value. The right-hand panel shows the relationship between prices in successive periods of time, called the price dynamics curve (PDC). If Pt, the price in period t, is equal to P0, then the price in the next period, Pt+1, will be the same, because at the equilibrium there is no tendency for change. But if the current price Pt is not at the equilibrium, the PDC shows what the price will be in the next period. Follow the steps in Figure 11.7 to see how, with a PDC like the one shown here, the market will return to equilibrium after a shock.












Figure 11.17 
A stable equilibrium in the market for FCC shares.
        















The equilibrium price


The left-hand panel shows the supply and demand curves in a market where the equilibrium price is P0. The 45 line on the right shows that when the price in period t is P0, the price in period t + 1 will be the same. There is no tendency to change.














A price shock


Suppose that, following a temporary blip in demand for shares, the price in this market is P1. There is excess supply.














The price adjusts


The PDC shows that if the price this period is P1, then it will be P2 next period.














Beliefs dampen prices


Since the PDC is flatter than the 45 line, P2 is closer to the equilibrium than P1. Investors are influenced by their beliefs about the fundamental value of FCC, which is P0.














Moving back to equilibrium


Prices get closer to P0. The process continues until equilibrium is regained.




In Figure 11.17, the PDC is flatter than the 45 line, so when the price is above the equilibrium, it will adjust downwards again until equilibrium is restored. This PDC represents the case in which beliefs about the fundamental value of the asset dominate any tendency to interpret the price rise as a signal of further price rises.
Lets now suppose that following the initial increase in the share price P1, demand increases: shares in FCC are now seen as a better investment. Even if everyone knows that the fundamental value of the shares is still P0, some people believe that the price will continue to rise for some time. If the conviction takes hold that the price will increase further, then owning more shares is a good strategy. There will be a capital gain from holding them because they can be sold later for more than the price paid to acquire them.

unstable equilibriumAn equilibrium such that, if a shockdisturbs theequilibrium, there is asubsequenttendency to move even further away from the equilibrium.

In this case, as shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 11.18, the higher price shifts the demand curve to the right. In the right-hand panel, the PDC is steeper than the 45 line. This tells us that the price next period is further from the equilibrium at P0 than the price this period. This PDC represents the case of an unstable equilibrium.











Figure 11.18 
An unstable equilibrium.
        




In the next period the price rises again. In a self-reinforcing bubble, this process can continue indefinitelyat least until something happens to change the expectation of continuously rising prices (and of a growing deviation of the price from its fundamental value).
Instability caused by self-reinforcing price expectations can only happen in markets for goods that can be resold, like financial assets or durable goods. There is no point buying more vegetables, fish, or fashion items in the hope of making a capital gain on them, because the fish and vegetables will rot, and fashions will change. However, in the markets for tulip bulbs in the seventeenth century, office space in Tokyo in the late 1980s, and houses in Las Vegas in the 2000s (see Exercise 11.10), people continued buying as prices rose, accelerating prices further, because they expected to benefit by reselling the asset.
In Unit 17 we will use a model with a price dynamics curve to look at the role of the housing market in the financial crisis of 2008. In Unit 20, a similar model helps explain how humans interact with the natural environment and why in some situations we observe both stabilizing processes and vicious circles of runaway environmental collapse.
Leibniz: Price bubbles
How do bubbles come to an end?
A bubble bursts when some participants in the market perceive a danger that the price will fall. Then would-be buyers hold back, and those who hold the assets will try to get rid of them. The process in Figure 11.15 is reversed. Figure 11.19 uses the supply and demand model to illustrate what happens. At the top of the bubble the shares trade at $80. Both the supply and demand curves shift when the bubble bursts, and the price collapses from $80 to $54leaving those who owned shares when the price was $80 with large losses.

If the price of an asset has been driven up solely by beliefs about future price rises, there should be opportunities for those who are well informed about the value to profit from their superior information. So if the rise in the Nasdaq index in Figure 11.14 was indeed a bubble, why did those who identified it as a bubble fail to profit by placing gigantic bets on a major price decline?

short sellingThe sale of an asset borrowed by the seller, with the intention of buying it back at a lower price. This strategy is adopted by investors expecting the value of an asset to decrease. Also known as: shorting.

As it happens, many large investors did lean against the wind by placing bets on the bubble bursting, including some well-known fund managers on Wall Street. They did so by selling short (shorting): borrowing shares at the current high price and immediately selling them, with the intention of buying them back cheaply (to return to the owner) after the price crashed. But this is an extremely risky strategy, since it requires accuracy in timing the crashif prices continue to rise, the losses can become unsustainable. You may be right about the bubble but if you get the timing wrong, then when you are due to buy the shares and return them to the owner, the price is higher than it was when you sold them. You will make a loss and may not be able to repay your loan.
Indeed, many of those buying an asset may also be convinced of an eventual crash, but hoping to exit the market before it happens. This was the case during the tech bubble when Stanley Druckenmiller, manager of the Quantum Fund with assets of $8 billion, held shares in technology companies that he knew were overvalued. After prices collapsed and inflicted significant losses on the fund, he used a baseball metaphor to describe his error. We thought it was the eighth inning, and it was the ninth, he explained, I overplayed my hand.

Exercise 11.7 What is the fundamental value of a Bitcoin?
A bubble may have occurred in the market for the virtual currency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin was introduced by a group of software developers in 2009. Where it is accepted, it can be transferred from one person to another as payment for goods and services.
Unlike other currencies it is not controlled by a single entity such as a central bank. Instead it is mined by individuals who lend their computing power to verify and record Bitcoin transactions in the public ledger. At the start of 2013, a Bitcoin could be purchased for about $13. On 4 December 2013 it was trading at $1,147. It then lost more than half its value in two weeks. These and subsequent price swings are shown in Figure 11.20.

Exercise 11.8 The big ten asset price bubbles of the last 400 years
According to Charles Kindleberger, an economic historian, asset price bubbles have occurred across a wide variety of countries and time periods. The bubbles of the last 100 years have predominantly been focused on real estate, stocks, and foreign investment.12

1636: The Dutch tulip bubble
1720: The South Sea Company
1720: The Mississippi Scheme
192729: The 1920s stock price bubble
1970s: The surge in loans to Mexico and other developing economies
198589: The Japanese bubble in real estate and stocks
198589: The bubble in real estate and stocks in Finland, Norway and Sweden
1990s: The bubble in real estate and stocks in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and several other Asian countries between 1992 and 1997, and the surge in foreign investment in Mexico 199099
19952000: The bubble in over-the-counter stocks in the US

Question 11.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements about asset prices are correct?

A bubble occurs when beliefs about future prices amplify a price rise.
When positive feedback occurs, the market is quickly restored to equilibrium.
Negative feedback is when prices give traders the wrong information about the fundamental value.
When beliefs dampen price rises, the market equilibrium is stable.


When beliefs amplify a price rise, the price moves further away from the fundamental value, causing a bubble.
Positive feedback is when an initial price change sets in motion a process that magnifies the initial change, so the market moves further away from equilibrium.
Negative feedback is when an initial price change is dampened by other market participants selling the asset, in the belief that the price is now above the fundamental value.
If beliefs about the fundamental value dampen a price rise, the market moves back to equilibrium.



Question 11.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements about short selling (shorting) is correct?

Shorting is used to benefit from a price fall.
Shorting involves selling shares that you currently own.
The maximum loss a trader can incur by shorting is the price he receives from the sale of the shares.
Shorting is a sure way of profiting from a suspected bubble.


Shorting allows a trader to benefit by selling borrowed shares while the price is high, and buying them back (to return to the owner) when the price has fallen.
Shorting involves selling shares that you have borrowed.
Once you have sold the shares at a certain price, there is no limit to the amount of loss you can incur, as the price can keep rising.
Shorting works only if your timing is correct (just as the bubble bursts). Otherwise the strategy can result in a large loss.
