Unit 19 Economic inequality
Economic disparities are mostly a matter of where you were born, who your parents are, and (in some countries) your gender. Well-designed policies and institutions can reduce inequalities without lowering average living standards

Having declined for most of the twentieth century, inequality of income then increased in the US, the UK, India, and many other countries.
Nonetheless, because of the rapid economic growth of China and India, countries with very large populations, income inequality among all people in the world has declined since the end of the twentieth century.
Discrimination based on race, gender, or religion, and other forms of unequal opportunity mean that otherwise identical people will have different incomes and economic opportunities, contributing to inequality.
Income disparities among people are due to what they own (for example, a piece of land), are (male or female), or have (particular skills) that enable them to receive income.
The institutions and policies in force in a society and the technologies used in production influence these determinants of income.
Some inequalities provide incentives to study and work hard, and to take the risks associated with innovation and investment.
But inequalities also restrict economic opportunities of the less well off and may also result in a more conflict-ridden society and impose costs, impairing economic performance.
Well-designed and implemented government policies can limit unfair economic inequality while raising average living standards, as has been done in many countries.

It is 1975. Renfu is the child of a local Communist Party leader. In 10 years, he will attend Tsinghua University, an elite engineering university in Beijing, and will join the Communist Party himself. In 20 years, he will run a state-owned enterprise. In 30 years, he will be CEO of the company after it is privatized, and be highly ranked within the Party.
However, Yichen, whose parents have no party connections, will not go to university, but instead work the land alongside her parents until she is 16, and then work at a state-owned enterprise making car parts for export to the US and Europe. When she is 30 years old, she will take a job in the new Motorola factory opening in nearby Tianjin, paying double her current wage. She will not be able to migrate legally to Tianjin and leaves her daughter behind with her parents.
Yichen and Renfu are hypothetical people. We could have inserted a disclaimer: All characters appearing in this work are fictitious But that would not be entirely truethey illustrate the divergent histories of real people alive today.
Lets also consider two other hypothetical people living in the US, also in 1975. Mark and Stephanie, both 17, live in Gary, Indiana. Mark is about to finish high school and start working in the local unionized steel mill with his father, where the pay is good and he doesnt have to spend four years in further education before earning a wage.
In the 1981 recession, Mark will lose his job. He will try to use his mechanical ability to open a car parts business. With little wealth of his own to post as collateral, he will not be able to obtain a bank loan, so he will move south to another factory. This one is non-unionized, and he will make less money than he did in Gary. In 2008, during the recession, his factory will replace him with a KUKA Robotics Corporation Titan industrial robot.
Stephanie, both of whose parents are doctors, decides she will attend Indiana University Bloomington, majoring in psychology. Afterwards she will work for a large financial corporation in Chicago and, after a series of promotions, becomes a vice-president for human resources. She will invest her savings in the stock market, which yields an average return of more than 10% for many years, and will benefit from government tax cuts that favour high earners.
These four people had very different life outcomes. Is there anything wrong with that? Each of the four made good choices knowing what they could have known at the time, everybody worked hard, and yet they had very different lives. We might say that they simply drew different hands in the card game of life.
Their parents are an important difference in the hands that they drew. This starts with the fact that Yichen and Renfu were born in China, and Mark and Stephanie in the US. The parents of the two in China were likely to be equally poor, although Communist Party members enjoyed a higher level of social prestige and education. The gap in wealth between the two sets of American parents would probably have been larger. If Mark was black the gap would be greater than if he was white, but his family would still have been far better off in material terms than both the Chinese families.
In 2017, the children of Stephanie and Renfu, who have been relatively successful in each country, will have access to a variety of opportunities not available to the children of Yichen and Mark. In China, Renfus children will attend better schools and have better job prospects because of their fathers connections. With luck, they may attend a US university, gain valuable work experience in the university-trained, English-speaking global labour market, and return to China with salaries many times those of the average Chinese citizen.
Yichens daughter will not obtain a high-quality primary or secondary education. This is because the hukou restrictions mean she must go to school in Yichens rural home district and not in Tianjin, where her mother works. Nevertheless, most likely she will be better off over her lifetime than her parents, and will certainly be better off than her grandparents.
In the US, Stephanies children will attend either a public school in her expensive neighbourhood, well funded by local property taxes, or an expensive private school. They will get early access to a much larger vocabulary, form lifelong friendships with other kids from their privileged background, and engage in a variety of interesting extracurricular experiences that help their educational performance and will help them get admission to elite universities. This will translate into average lifetime earnings of close to $800,000 greater than the earnings of those whose education finishes at high school level.1
Marks children will have to deal with poorly funded public schools, the absence of union jobs, a minimum wage that will be worth less in real terms than it was in their parents generation, and changes in technology and trade that will amplify the effects of these problems. The life trajectories of these four people illustrate just a few of the global changes in the distribution of income that have occurred in the past 40 years.
Inequality exists across many dimensions, including income, wealth, education, health, and other opportunities. In this unit, we will focus primarily on inequalities in wealth and income, both because they have been studied extensively by economists and because they are strongly related to other forms of inequality. We begin with three sets of facts:23

Inequality of income: In the next section, we survey evidence from around the globe about inequalities in income and how they have changed in the past century.
Accidents of birth: We then look at inequality through an alternative lens. Accidents of birth influence ones income, whether it be ones nation, race, gender, wealth, or even the quality and extent of ones schooling.
The future of inequality: The last set of facts offers a glimpse into the future of the rich economies, looking at the kinds of jobs available as automation and the global relocation of industrial production accelerate the transition from a manufacturing to a service-producing economy.

We then ask why inequality is widely seen as a problem, and provide a way to approach the question of whether there is too much (or too little) inequality. We present a model of the causes of economic inequality in order to understand how public policies and other changes can alter the degree of economic inequality. And we then use this model to explain both recent changes in the levels of economic inequality in a number of countries, and the effects of government policies on the degree of inequality.

Exercise 19.1 Income variation across and within countries
In Unit 1, Figure 1.2 showed the distribution of income across and within countries in 2014. The height of each bar in the chart varies along two axes. The first axis of variation, from left to right of the figure, is a ranking of countries according to gross domestic income per capita from the poorest on the left (Liberia), to the richest on the right (Singapore). The second axis, from the front to the back of the figure, shows the distribution of income from poor to rich within each country.

Go back over the stories of Mark, Renfu, Stefanie, and Yichen and make your guess about which decile fits each of the fictional characters. Briefly justify your choice.
