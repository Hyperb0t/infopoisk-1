3.4 The feasible set
Now we return to Alexeis problem of how to choose between grades and free time. Free time has an opportunity cost in the form of lost percentage points in his grade (equivalently, we might say that percentage points have an opportunity cost in the form of the free time Alexei has to give up to obtain them). But before we can describe how Alexei resolves his dilemma, we need to work out precisely which alternatives are available to him.
To answer this question, we look again at the production function. This time we will show how the final grade depends on the amount of free time, rather than study time. There are 24 hours in a day. Alexei must divide this time between studying (all the hours devoted to learning) and free time (all the rest of his time). Figure 3.9 shows the relationship between his final grade and hours of free time per daythe mirror image of Figure 3.5. If Alexei studies solidly for 24 hours, that means zero hours of free time and a final grade of 90. If he chooses 24 hours of free time per day, we assume he will get a grade of zero.

feasible frontierThe curve made of points that defines the maximum feasible quantity of one good for a given quantity of the other. See also: feasible set.

In Figure 3.9, the axes are final grade and free time, the two goods that give Alexei utility. If we think of him choosing to consume a combination of these two goods, the curved line in Figure 3.9 shows what is feasible. It represents his feasible frontier: the highest grade he can achieve given the amount of free time he takes. Follow the steps in Figure 3.9 to see which combinations of grade and free time are feasible, and which are not, and how the slope of the frontier represents the opportunity cost of free time.

The feasible frontier


This curve is called the feasible frontier. It shows the highest final grade Alexei can achieve given the amount of free time he takes. With 24 hours of free time, his grade would be zero. By having less free time, Alexei can achieve a higher grade.














A feasible combination


If Alexei chooses 13 hours of free time per day, he can achieve a grade of 84.














Infeasible combinations


Given Alexeis abilities and conditions of study, under normal conditions he cannot take 20 hours of free time and expect to get a grade of 70 (remember, we are assuming that luck plays no part). Therefore B is an infeasible combination of hours of free time and final grade.














A feasible combination


The maximum grade Alexei can achieve with 19 hours of free time per day is 57.














Inside the frontier


Combination D is feasible, but Alexei is wasting time or points in the exam. He could get a higher grade with the same hours of study per day, or have more free time and still get a grade of 70.














The feasible set


The area inside the frontier, together with the frontier itself, is called the feasible set. (A set is a collection of thingsin this case all the feasible combinations of free time and grade.)














The opportunity cost of free time


At combination A Alexei could get an extra hour of free time by giving up 3 points in the exam. The opportunity cost of an hour of free time at A is 3 points.














The opportunity cost varies


The more free time he takes, the higher the marginal product of studying, so the opportunity cost of free time increases. At C the opportunity cost of an hour of free time is higher than at A: Alexei would have to give up 7 points.














The slope of the feasible frontier


The opportunity cost of free time at C is 7 points, corresponding to the slope of the feasible frontier. At C, Alexei would have to give up 7 percentage points (the vertical change is 7) to increase his free time by 1 hour (the horizontal change is 1). The slope is 7.





feasible setAll of the combinations of the things under consideration that a decision-maker could choose given the economic, physical or other constraints that he faces. See also: feasible frontier.

Any combination of free time and final grade that is on or inside the frontier is feasible. Combinations outside the feasible frontier are said to be infeasible given Alexeis abilities and conditions of study. On the other hand, even though a combination lying inside the frontier is feasible, choosing it would imply Alexei has effectively thrown away something that he values. If he studied for 14 hours a day, then according to our model, he could guarantee himself a grade of 89. But he could obtain a lower grade (70, say), if he just stopped writing before the end of the exam. It would be foolish to throw away points like this for no reason, but it would be possible. Another way to obtain a combination inside the frontier might be to sit in the library doing nothingAlexei would be taking less free time than is available to him, which again makes no sense.
By choosing a combination inside the frontier, Alexei would be giving up something that is freely availablesomething that has no opportunity cost. He could obtain a higher grade without sacrificing any free time, or have more time without reducing his grade.
The feasible frontier is a constraint on Alexeis choices. It represents the trade-off he must make between grade and free time. At any point on the frontier, taking more free time has an opportunity cost in terms of grade points foregone, corresponding to the slope of the frontier.

marginal rate of transformation (MRT)The quantity of some good that must be sacrificed to acquire one additional unit of another good. At any point, it is the slope of the feasible frontier. See also: marginal rate of substitution.

Another way to express the same idea is to say that the feasible frontier shows the marginal rate of transformation: the rate at which Alexei can transform free time into grade points. Look at the slope of the frontier between points A and E in Figure 3.9.

The slope of AE (vertical distance divided by horizontal distance) is 3.
At point A, Alexei could get one more unit of free time by giving up 3 grade points. The opportunity cost of a unit of free time is 3.
At point E, Alexei could transform one unit of time into 3 grade points. The marginal rate at which he can transform free time into grade points is 3.

Note that the slope of AE is only an approximation to the slope of the frontier. More precisely, the slope at any point is the slope of the tangent, and this represents both the MRT and the opportunity cost at that point.
Note that we have now identified two trade-offs:
Leibniz: Marginal rates of transformation and substitution

The marginal rate of substitution (MRS): In the previous section, we saw that it measures the trade-off that Alexei is willing to make between final grade and free time.
The marginal rate of transformation (MRT): In contrast, this measures the trade-off that Alexei is constrained to make by the feasible frontier.

As we shall see in the next section, the choice Alexei makes between his grade and his free time will strike a balance between these two trade-offs.

Question 3.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Look at Figure 3.5 which shows Alexeis production function: how the final grade (the output) depends on the number of hours spent studying (the input).
Free time per day is given by 24 hours minus the hours of study per day. Consider Alexeis feasible set of combinations of final grade and hours of free time per day. What can we conclude?

To find the feasible set one needs to know the number of hours that Alexei sleeps per day.
The feasible frontier is a mirror image of the production function above.
The feasible frontier is horizontal between 0 and 10 hours of free time per day.
The marginal product of labour at 10 hours of study equals the marginal rate of transformation at 14 hours of free time.


The hours of free time per day is already given as 24 hours minus the hours of study per day. Therefore, the number of hours spent sleeping is included in the hours of free time.
Given that the production function is just the feasible frontier except that it takes negative free time (hours of study) as its input, the former is simply the latter mirrored across the horizontal axis and shifted horizontally.
The production function is horizontal after 15 hours of study per day. Therefore, the feasible frontier is horizontal only up to 9 hours of free time per day.
10 hours of study is equivalent to 14 hours of free time given a 24-hour day, and the marginal product of labour (additional output per labour hour) is the same as the marginal rate of transformation (trade-off between extra output and labour), so these two values are equal.
