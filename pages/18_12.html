18.11 Conclusion
The worlds economies are now part of an integrated global system. Major companies consider the entire world when deciding where to produce and where to sell their goods and services. Investors, likewise, choose where to hold their assets, whether financial or real, on the basis of calculations of expected returns after taxes in all the regions of the world. But we have also seen that labour has for the most part not been globalized, and for political, cultural, and language reasons remains largely national. National borders remain an essential fact of the global economy. National governments remain major actors in affecting the course of their own and other economies.
Globalization has brought about important changes. In the eighteenth century, at the birth of economics as a discipline, goods were traded across national boundaries, and investments were made in far-flung parts of the world; but for the most part the nation and its economy had the same boundaries.
The world today looks quite different. Trading of goods and services and investment are now integrated into the world financial system in which transactions are made electronically in milliseconds.
Economists can help to design and evaluate policies that secure the greatest possible mutual gains among the worlds people participating in this new dynamic and cosmopolitan economy. They can also identify groups whose livelihoods are under threat from the globalization process and propose policies to ensure that the gains made possible from worldwide investment and exchange are fairly shared.
