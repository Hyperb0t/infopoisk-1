20.7 Dynamic environmental policies: Future technologies and lifestyles
The trade-offs given by the feasible sets and indifference curves we have used in our analysis will change as people adopt new values and lifestyles and develop new technologies, and as our impact on the environment intensifies.
Prices, quantities and green innovation

marginal productivity of abatement expendituresThe marginal rate of transformation (MRT) of abatement costs into improved environment. It is the slope of the feasible frontier. See also: marginal rate of transformation, feasible frontier.

Improvements in technology can enlarge the feasible set. Some improvements may make abatement more efficient, lowering the opportunity cost of an improved environment. Others may improve methods of producing goods, reducing the environmental costs of consumption as a result. Figure 20.18 illustrates the effect of a technological improvement, which improves the marginal rate of transformation of foregone consumption into abatement (otherwise known as the marginal productivity of abatement expenditure), and hence into an improvement in environmental quality. By increasing the marginal productivity of abatement expenditure, it makes the feasible frontier steeper.

In Unit 2, you learned how the rents from innovation drive progress and the improvement of productivity. If the right incentives exist to create innovation rents, we would expect technological breakthroughs that can deliver substitutes for some resources that would otherwise be used up, or that need to stay in the ground if climate change is to be safely limited. One such case is the technological progress achieved in solar energy.3

learning by doingThis occurs when the output per unit of inputs increases with greater experience in producing a good or service.

Subsidies to firms producing the panels and other equipment has helped fund research and development in these new sources of electricity. Subsidies to those installing solar panels have increased demand. The growth of demand has in turn led to a sharp decrease in the price of solar panels thanks to learning by doing in the production process, which makes production cheaper and cheaper.
The idea that environmental regulation can create greater efficiency and be an incentive to innovation is known as the Porter Hypothesis, because it was first argued by Michael Porter, an economist, in 1995. He argued that the costs of regulation led firms to look for cleaner, more efficent technologies. The benefits of these technologies compensate both the costs of regulation, and the costs of innovation.
Figures 20.19a and b show the dramatic improvement in photovoltaic cell efficiency over the last few decades, which has led to a reduction in the cost of producing solar electricity.

In the US, many renewable energy technologies can already compete with fossil fuel generation without the need for subsidies, in terms of the total cost per unit of electricity generated, as shown in Figure 20.19b. However, since we can only generate wind power when the wind blows and solar power when the sun shines, renewable energy generation can be less reliable than fossil fuel generation. Fossil fuel generation may therefore be preferred in the absence of subsidies, even though the unit costs for solar power are lower.

To illustrate how a tax can create innovation rents by changing relative prices and promote innovation by the private sector, we apply a model introduced in Unit 2. Imagine a textile producer called Olympiad Industries (a hypothetical business), located in a country where the supply of electricity is intermittent, and so like most firms in the country it owns a coal-fired power generator. Burning fossil fuel generates greenhouse gases but the alternative (solar power) is more expensive. While the firm has installed some solar panels, it relies primarily on coal for electricity generation.
Figure 20.20 illustrates the cost comparison. You will be familiar with the model: it is the one in Unit 2 in which we explained how relatively high wages in England made the introduction of a labour-saving innovation (the spinning jenny) profitable. The difference is that we are not considering an innovation that saves labour but instead saves environmental resources, many of which (unlike labour in England in the eighteenth century) have no price.
In this figure, we study the effects of a tax on carbon-based energy sources on a firms choice of technology. Prior to the tax, the coal-intensive technology was the cost-minimizing way to produce. Hence there was no incentive for a firm to develop and use renewable energy sources, and as a result, there were no profits to gain from developing the alternative to coal. After the tax, the firm would save the equivalent of a tonne of coal per unit of output by developing and using the solar technology.

Olympiad Industries choice of technology: The effect of an environmental tax on firm behaviour.
        















Technologies A and B


Both technologies produce 100 metres of textiles: A is coal-intensive and B is solar-intensive. The new technology, B, uses almost entirely solar power with just a bit of coal use for periods of the year when solar power is unreliable.














The firms isocost line


The isocost line shows all of the possible combinations of solar and coal (sufficient to produce 100 metres of textiles) that have the same cost. If the isocost is HJ, firms use technology A, because B costs more (it lies outside the line HJ). The flat slope of the isocost line says that coal is a bargain.














Taxing fossil fuels


A tax per kilowatt-hour on the use of coal for energy-generation is introduced. This means that for the same cost as 4 tonnes of coal, the firm could now be using 8 solar panels.














The new isocost line


The solar-intensive technology B is on the blue isocost line and is now cheaper than the status quo A-technology.




The comparison of costs gives the owner of Olympiad a reason to adopt solar technology. Here the tax has changed the message sent by prices. It now says that you can make a profit by using renewable sources of energy. It also says that sticking with coal may mean being undercut by your competitors, if they switch to the lower-cost technology.
Environmental policy and long-term changes in lifestyles
In the long run, in addition to the role of policy in green innovation, how much we value the goods that contribute to our wellbeing can also change. Recall our discussion of social preferences from Unit 4. We saw that individual behaviours can be motivated by a desire to contribute to the common good. Below, you see how economists apply this general idea of pro-social preferences to evaluate the potential contribution of such preferences to environmental conservation.

How economists learn from facts Social preferences and environmental sustainability

social preferencesPreferences that place a value on what happens to other people, even if it results in lower payoffs for the individual.

Do the kinds of altruistic and reciprocal social preferences that we studied in Unit 4 motivate people to act in ways that will sustain the environment? This is not an easy question to answer because people are naturally happy to attribute their environmentally friendly actions to their green values, even if the latter were not really the reason for the action.
But two experimental studies suggest that social preferences do support green actions.
In the northeastern region of Brazil, shrimp are caught in large plastic bucket-like contraptions; the fishermen cut holes in the bottoms of the traps to allow the immature shrimp to escape, thereby preserving the stock for future catches. The fishermen thus face a real-world social dilemma like the ones we studied in Unit 4: the expected income of each would be greater if he were to cut smaller holes in his traps (increasing his own catch) while others cut larger holes in theirs (preserving future stocks).
In prisoners dilemma terms, small trap holes are a form of defection that maximizes the individuals material payoff irrespective of what others do (it is the dominant strategy). But a shrimper might resist the temptation to defect if he were both public spirited toward the other fishermen and sufficiently patient to value the future opportunities that they all would lose if he were to use traps with smaller holes.
Experimental economists Ernst Fehr and Andreas Leibbrandt implemented both a public good experimental game and an experimental measure of impatience with the shrimpers. Like the experiments in Unit 4, both were played anonymously and the payoffs were real. Those who did not contribute in the public goods game went home with more money than the cooperative types who contributed.4
The researchers found that the shrimpers with both greater patience and greater cooperativeness in the experimental game punched significantly larger holes in their traps, thereby protecting future stocks for the entire community. The effects, controlling for a large number of other possible influences on hole size, were substantial.
Additional evidence that social preferences can support green outcomes comes from a set of experiments and field studies with 49 groups of herders of the Bale Oromo people in Ethiopia, who were engaged in forest-commons management. Devesh Rustagi and his co-authors implemented public-goods experiments with a total of 679 herders, and also studied the success of the herders cooperative forest projects.5
The most common behavioural type in the experiments, constituting just over a third of the subjects, were conditional cooperators, who reciprocated higher contributions by others by contributing more to the public good themselves. Controlling for a large number of other influences on the success of the forest projects, the authors found that groups with a larger number of conditional cooperators were more successful (planted more new trees) than those with fewer conditional cooperators.
This was in part because members of groups with more conditional cooperators spent significantly more time monitoring others use of the forest. As with the Brazilian shrimpers, differences in the fraction of conditional cooperators in a group were associated with substantial increases in trees planted or time spent monitoring others.
This does not mean that generous, cooperative, and reciprocal preferences are sufficient to address problems of environmental sustainability. But it does show that these social preferences can help.

We saw above that environmental behaviours can arise because of pro-social preferences. But they can also arise because of changes in lifestyles. The example of the Netherlands will illustrate this point.
In Figure 3.1, you saw that production workers in the Netherlands worked fewer than half as many hours in the year 2000 as they had in 1900. In 2000 they enjoyed a lot more free time and consumed less than half as many goods and services as they would have done had they continued working more than 3,000 hours a year, as they did in 1900. If they still worked long hours and used all these earnings for consumption, their adverse impact on the environment would be larger.
Look ahead to Figure 20.25a, which shows the CO2 emissions and GDP per capita for a wide range of countries. As a thought experiment, imagine that the Netherlands were twice as rich as it is in that graph. What would be the environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions? In that figure the Netherlands is slightly below the predicted line so if we assume that this was also true of our hypothetical workaholic Dutch nation, we can determine the level of CO2 emissions using the line of best fit. Instead of emitting 11 tonnes of CO2 per capita per year, they would be emitting more than 20 tonnes. This would make the Netherlands among the top polluters in the world.
The Netherlands experienced an unusually large fall in its work hours (Figure 3.1 shows that work hours in France and the US fell, but not on the same scale as the Dutch). But even for these and other countries, if free time had not expanded at the opportunity cost of less consumption, the impact on global climate change would have been worse.
A lifestyle that is rich in free time, and less rich than it could be in goods and services produced in the economy, is a greener lifestyle. Environmental policies can contribute to people adopting this lifestyle.
To see how, imagine that Omar is considering how far to travel by air for his holiday. Omar has enough income to fly anywhere, but he knows that burning aviation fuel is a major source of greenhouse gases. He would also like to have more free time, but realizes that a shorter working week would mean he has less money for his next holiday.
We represent the trade-offs affecting his choice in Figure 20.21. On the horizontal axis we measure hours of free time per year. On the vertical axis we indicate his kilometres of air travel during the year. The red line gives the total amount of air travel that he can afford for each choice of free time. The red line is therefore his feasible air travel/free time frontier.
The feasible frontier is constructed as follows. Suppose Omar makes $50 an hour after taxes and that he is free to set his own hours of work. He spends $90,000 on things other than air travel and to earn this amount, he must work 1,800 hours during the year. So, from the 8,760 hours in the year that he could give to work (as in Unit 3), he chooses to work 1,800 hours. Thus he has 6,960 hours of free time if he takes no air travel at all: this is the horizontal axis intercept of the frontier. How much air travel will he choose if $1 buys 4 km of air travel?
Omars preferences for free time and air travel are given by the indifference curves shown. The slope of the indifference curve indicates how much he values free time relative to air travel, that is, his MRS of free time for air travel.
Work through the analysis in Figure 20.21 to follow Omars decision making.












Figure 20.21 
Omars choice: The effect of an environmental tax on choices of air travel and free time.
        















The feasible frontier


The marginal rate of transformation of foregone free time into air travel is the slope of the feasible frontier. By giving up an hour of free time, Omar can work for an additional hour and earn $50. Each dollar gets him 4 km of air travel, so the MRT is 200. Giving up an hour of free time gets him 200 km of feasible air travel.














The highest indifference curve that Omar can reach


This is point A. It results from his choosing to work 200 extra hours so he has 6,760 hours of free time and 40,000 km of air travel.














The private cost of travel


To Omar, the private cost of 1 km of air travel is $0.25.














A fuel tax


Consider a tax levied on aviation fuel, so that the price of air travel rises. As a result, a dollar spent on a ticket now purchases only 2 km of air travel. This tax could force airlines and consumers to account for the negative environmental effects of air travel.














Omars choice


Omar chooses the point on the new dashed feasible frontier that is on the highest indifference curve, which is now point B.





income effectThe effect that the additional income would have if there were no change in the price or opportunity cost.substitution effectThe effect that is only due to changes in the price or opportunity cost, given the new level of utility.

Omar flies less. There are two reasons for the change:

The income effect: Omars choices are now more limited than before because the price of something that he consumes has gone up. His real income has fallen.
The substitution effect: The tax has increased the relative price of air travel, leading Omar to substitute to other ways of having a good life, by consuming other goods (not shown in the figure), working less, or both.


Exercise 20.9 Improvements in technology

Redraw Figure 20.18 to show an improvement in the technology for producing consumption goods, instead of an improvement in abatement technology.
Based on your diagram, explain what happens to the feasible frontier and the optimal choice of environmental quality and consumption, assuming nothing else changes.



Exercise 20.10 The price elasticity of demand
A study of vehicle use and gasoline prices in California estimated that the short-run price elasticity of demand for the number of miles a car is driven is 0.22. Suppose the price of gas is now $3per gallon and a proposed tax would raise the price to $4 per gallon.

For someone who drives 200 miles per week, what is the predicted reduction in the miles driven if the tax is implemented?

The same study found that people with higher incomes responded more to gas price changes than people with lower incomes.

Can you think of reasons why this may be the case?
Sketch two demand curves reflecting the difference in price responsiveness among different income groups: one for high-income people and one for low-income people. Show why the tax will impose a larger cost on the low-income group.



Question 20.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Figure 20.20, points A and B are the two technologies available to a firm in its production. Specifically, technology A uses 4tonnes of coal and 2 m2 of solar panel to produce 100 metres of textiles, while technology B uses 1 tonne of coal and 6 m2 of solar panel for the same output.
Initially, the price of 1 tonne of coal is half that of the price of using 1m2 of solar panel. In its latest budget statement, the government proposes a tax on the use of coal such that the price ratio increases from 1/2 to 2. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

At the original prices, the firms isocost line is given by FG.
At the original prices, the firm chooses technology B as it is on a higher isocost line than A.
After the implementation of the tax, the slope of the firms isocost line steepens from 1/2 to 2.
After the implementation of the tax, the firm chooses technology A as it is on a lower isocost line than B.


False. The firms isocost line at the original prices is given by JH.
False. The firm chooses technology A because it is on the lower isocost line, indicating lower costs per unit of output.
True. This is shown in the graph as the shift from JH to GF.
False. The firm chooses technology B because it is on the lower isocost line, indicating lower costs per unit of output.



Question 20.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram shows a consumers choice of the amount of air travel per year, using indifference curves between hours of free time per year and kilometres of air travel. The consumer cannot afford air travel when he chooses 6,960 hours of free time. The consumers after-tax hourly wage is $50.












Initially, the cost of a 1 km of air travel is $0.25. In its latest budget statement, the government proposes a fuel tax such that the cost of 1km of air travel doubles to $0.50. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The marginal rate of transformation between kilometres of air travel and free time rises from 100 to 200 as a result of the fuel tax.
The substitution effect of the tax means that the consumer substitutes out of air travel into consumption of other goods by working more.
The income effect of the tax means that the consumer will unambiguously consume more free hours.
If the fuel tax reflects the social cost of the consumers air travel, then the socially optimal level of travelling is 15,000 km per year.


False. The marginal rate of transformation falls from 200 to 100 due to the tax.
False. The substitution effect implies that the consumer substitutes away from air travel. We have assumed that consumption of other goods is fixed, so the consumer instead substitutes into free time. In reality, the consumer may substitute into both free time and consumption of other goods.
False. The income effect could increase or decrease free hours, depending on the preferences of the consumer.
True. The diagram indicates that 15,000 km per year is the optimal choice at the new price, which internalizes all the relevant externalities from air travel.
