4.6 Public goods, free riding, and repeated interaction
Now lets look at the second reason for an unfortunate outcome in the prisoners dilemma game. There was no way that either Anil or Bala (or anyone else) could make whoever used the insecticide pay for the harm that it caused.
The problems of Anil and Bala are hypothetical, but they capture the real dilemmas of free riding that many people around the world face. For example, as in Spain, many farmers in southeast Asia rely on a shared irrigation facility to produce their crops. The system requires constant maintenance and new investment. Each farmer faces the decision of how much to contribute to these activities. These activities benefit the entire community and if the farmer does not volunteer to contribute, others may do the work anyway.
Imagine there are four farmers who are deciding whether to contribute to the maintenance of an irrigation project.

public goodA good for which use by one person does not reduce its availability to others. Also known as: non-rival good. See also: non-excludable public good, artificially scarce good.

For each farmer, the cost of contributing to the project is $10. But when one farmer contributes, all four of them will benefit from an increase in their crop yields made possible by irrigation, so they will each gain $8. Contributing to the irrigation project is called a public good: when one individual bears a cost to provide the good, everyone receives a benefit.
Now, consider the decision facing Kim, one of the four farmers. Figure 4.7 shows how her decision depends on her total earnings, but also on the number of other farmers who decide to contribute to the irrigation project.

For example, if two of the others contribute, Kim will receive a benefit of $8 from each of their contributions. So if she makes no contribution herself, her total payoff, shown in red, is $16. If she decides to contribute, she will receive an additional benefit of $8 (and so will the other three farmers). But she will incur a cost of $10, so her total payoff is $14, as in Figure 4.7, and as calculated in Figure 4.8.

Example: When two others contribute, Kims payoff is lower if she contributes too.
        




Figures 4.7 and 4.8 illustrate the social dilemma. Whatever the other farmers decide to do, Kim makes more money if she doesnt contribute than if she does. Not contributing is a dominant strategy. She can free ride on the contributions of the others.
This public goods game is a prisoners dilemma in which there are more than two players. If the farmers care only about their own monetary payoff, there is a dominant strategy equilibrium in which no one contributes and their payoffs are all zero. On the other hand, if all contributed, each would get $22. Everyone would benefit if everyone cooperated, but irrespective of what others do, each farmer does better by free riding on the others.
Altruism could help to solve the free rider problem: if Kim cared about the other farmers, she might be willing to contribute to the irrigation project. But if large numbers of people are involved in a public goods game, it is less likely that altruism will be sufficient to sustain a mutually beneficial outcome.
Yet around the world, real farmers and fishing people have faced public goods situations in many cases with great success. The evidence gathered by Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, and other researchers on common irrigation projects in India, Nepal, and other countries, shows that the degree of cooperation varies. In some communities a history of trust encourages cooperation. In others, cooperation does not happen. In south India, for example, villages with extreme inequalities in land and caste status had more conflicts over water usage. Less unequal villages maintained irrigation systems better: it was easier to sustain cooperation.8

Great economists Elinor Ostrom

The choice of Elinor Ostrom (19332012), a political scientist, as a co-recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize surprised most economists. For example, Steven Levitt, a professor at the University of Chicago, admitted he knew nothing about her work, and had no recollection of ever seeing or hearing her name mentioned by an economist.
Some, however, vigorously defended the decision. Vernon Smith, an experimental economist who had previously been awarded the Prize, congratulated the Nobel committee for recognizing her originality, scientific common sense and willingness to listen carefully to data.
Ostroms entire academic career was focused on a concept that plays a central role in economics but is seldom examined in much detail: property. Ronald Coase had established the importance of clearly delineated property rights when one persons actions affected the welfare of others. But Coases main concern was the boundary between the individual and the state in regulating such actions. Ostrom explored the middle ground where communities, rather than individuals or formal governments, held property rights.
The conventional wisdom at the time was that informal collective ownership of resources would lead to a tragedy of the commons. That is, economists believed that resources could not be used efficiently and sustainably under a common property regime. Thanks to Elinor Ostrom this is no longer a dominant view.
First, she made a distinction between resources held as common property and those subject to open access:

Common property involves a well-defined community of users who are able in practice, if not under the law, to prevent outsiders from exploiting the resource. Inshore fisheries, grazing lands, or forest areas are examples.
Open-access resources such as ocean fisheries or the atmosphere as a carbon sink, can be exploited without restrictions, other than those imposed by states acting alone or through international agreements.


social normAn understanding that is common to most members of a society about what people should do in a given situation when their actions affect others.

Ostrom was not alone in stressing this distinction, but she drew on a unique combination of case studies, statistical methods, game theoretic models with unorthodox ingredients, and laboratory experiments to try to understand how tragedies of the commons could be averted.
She discovered great diversity in how common property is managed. Some communities were able to devise rules and draw on social norms to enforce sustainable resource use, while others failed to do so. Much of her career was devoted to identifying the criteria for success, and using theory to understand why some arrangements worked well while others did not.
Many economists believed that the diversity of outcomes could be understood using the theory of repeated games, which predicts that even when all individuals care only for themselves, if interactions are repeated with sufficiently high likelihood and individuals are patient enough, then cooperative outcomes can be sustained indefinitely.
But this was not a satisfying explanation for Ostrom, partly because the same theory predicted that any outcome, including rapid depletion, could also arise.
More importantly, Ostrom knew that sustainable use was enforced by actions that clearly deviated from the hypothesis of material self-interest. In particular, individuals would willingly bear considerable costs to punish violators of rules or norms. As the economist Paul Romer put it, she recognized the need to expand models of human preferences to include a contingent taste for punishing others.
Ostrom developed simple game theoretic models in which individuals have unorthodox preferences, caring directly about trust and reciprocity. And she looked for the ways in which people faced with a social dilemma avoided tragedy by changing the rules so that the strategic nature of the interaction was transformed.
She worked with economists to run a pioneering series of experiments, confirming the widespread use of costly punishment in response to excessive resource extraction, and also demonstrated the power of communication and the critical role of informal agreements in supporting cooperation. Thomas Hobbes, a seventeenth-century philosopher, had asserted that agreements had to be enforced by governments, since covenants, without the sword, are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all. Ostrom disagreed. As she wrote in the title of an influential article, covenantseven without a swordmake self-governance possible.9

Social preferences partly explain why these communities avoid Garrett Hardins tragedy of the commons. But they may also find ways of deterring free-riding behaviour.
Repeated games
Free riding today on the contributions of other members of ones community may have unpleasant consequences tomorrow or years from now. Ongoing relationships are an important feature of social interactions that was not captured in the models we have used so far: life is not a one-shot game.
The interaction between Anil and Bala in our model was a one-shot game. But as owners of neighbouring fields, Anil and Bala are more realistically portrayed as interacting repeatedly.
Imagine how differently things would work out if we represented their interaction as a game to be repeated each season. Suppose that Bala has adopted IPC. What is Anils best response? He would reason like this:

Anil
If I play IPC, then maybe Bala will continue to do so, but if I use Terminatorwhich would raise my profits this seasonBala would use Terminator next year. So unless I am extremely impatient for income now, Id better stick with IPC.

Bala could reason in exactly the same way. The result might be that they would then continue playing IPC forever.
In the next section, we will look at experimental evidence of how people behave when a public goods game is repeated.

Question 4.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Four farmers are deciding whether to contribute to the maintenance of an irrigation project. For each farmer, the cost of contributing to the project is $10. But for each farmer who contributes, all four of them will benefit from an increase in their crop yields, so they will each gain $8.
Which of the following statements is correct?

If all the farmers are selfish, none of them will contribute.
If one of the farmers, Kim, cares about her neighbour Jim just as much as herself, she will contribute $10.
If Kim is altruistic and contributes $10, the others might contribute too, even if they are selfish.
If the farmers have to reconsider this decision every year, they might choose to contribute to the project even if they are selfish.


Do Not Contribute is a dominant strategy for all the farmers: whatever the others do, their own benefit from contributing is $8, but the cost is $10.
In this case she will gain $16 from contributing, which is higher than the cost.
Whatever Kim does, the dominant strategy for a selfish farmer is Do Not Contribute.
If the farmers have an ongoing relationship they may all decide to contribute, to gain the future benefits of continued cooperation. If any of the neighbours failed to contribute in any year, cooperation would break down. Knowing this, they would have an incentive to contribute in the present.
