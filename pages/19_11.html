19.10 Redistribution: Taxes and transfers
Differences among economies in the extent and nature of redistribution
Our models of wages and profits try to explain market income. But that is not the amount of income that people have to spend, nor does it include things essential to our livelihoods that we do not purchase, but instead acquire as a matter of citizenship.
Disposable income, as you know, is the income a person has after paying any income taxes and social security contributions, and after receiving any government transfers. But this is not an adequate measure of a households living standard because it does not include the effects of indirect taxes, such as value added tax, and the extent to which free or subsidized public services such as public education and health are available to households.

in-kind transfersPublic expenditure in the form of free or subsidized services for households rather than in the form of cash transfers.

These public expenditures are called in-kind transfers because they are a transfer to households in the form of free or subsidized services, rather than in the form of cash. When we take into account both indirect taxes and in-kind transfers, we arrive at a third income concept, called final income. Final income is the most complete measure of the living standard of a household. It tells us the value of all the goods and services that the household is able to consume. Figure 19.26 summarizes the relationship between these three income concepts.

Figure 19.27 shows the Gini coefficients for market income, disposable income, and final income for three large middle-income countries. In South Africa, direct taxes and transfers reduce the Gini by 0.08, from 0.77 to 0.69. Indirect taxes and public services reduce the Gini by a further 0.09 to 0.60 for final income, but it remains exceptionally unequal. Brazil had much higher inequality than Mexico in both market income and disposable income, but the Gini coefficient for final income falls to almost the same level as Mexicos, at 0.44 compared to 0.43.

The welfare state

welfare stateA set of government policies designed to provide improvements in the welfare of citizens by assisting with income smoothing (for example, unemployment benefits and pensions).

The policies that turn market income into final income are often referred to as the welfare state. These policies can be broken down into the taxation side and the expenditure side. The taxation side is any policy that collects revenue for the government, while the expenditure side is any policy that either gives money to households, or spends money on their behalf. We will see more about the composition of government expenditures in Unit 22.
In countries where redistribution reduces inequality by a lot, most of this work is done by expenditures, rather than taxation.
In the 28 countries in the European Union, the average Gini in 2015 for market income is 0.46, which taxes and transfers reduce to 0.27 for disposable income. But taxes only achieve 0.04 of that redistribution, with the remaining 0.15 driven by transfers to households. This doesnt mean that they have low tax rates, but instead it means that rich and poor pay similar shares of their incomes in taxes. On the other hand, poorer households benefit proportionally much more from expenditures.
Data on the Gini coefficient for the EU was taken from Effects of tax-benefit components on inequality (Gini index), 20112015 policies, which you can access on the Euromod statistics website.
Transfers, both in cash and in kind, have a large impact on inequality. But in most cases this is not their purpose. Most transfers are justified for other reasons, and reducing inequality is just a desirable side effect. Public education, for instance, has many justifications, including as an investment in human capital that makes the country more productive. Public health subsidies are often justified on the basis of a basic human right to life and to good health.
The welfare state is often represented and debated as a system of redistribution from the rich to the poor. But it is equally seen, and often defended, as redistribution from the lucky to the unlucky. Parts of the welfare state also redistribute from the young to the old.

social insuranceExpenditure by the government, financed by taxation, which provides protection against various economic risks (for example, loss of income due to sickness, or unemployment) and enables people to smooth incomes throughout their lifetime. See also: co-insurance.

In countries with large welfare states, much of the expenditure is on forms of social insurance, which includes assistance to poor households, but also includes public pensions, unemployment benefits, social housing, child benefits, and other expenditures that are targeted at groups that are not defined by low income. Public pensions transfer income to the old. Child benefits, like expenditures on public education, transfer income to the young (or those who care for them). Since they are paid for by taxes contributed by working adults, they are a way for society to enable people to smooth incomes throughout their lifetimes. We receive income from the government when we are very young and very old, when our incomes are low or zero, and we pay some of it back to the government when we are of working age and receiving a salary.
Similarly, public unemployment insurance is a way for people of working age to smooth their incomes in the face of the risk of unemployment. We pay while we are working, and we receive payments if we are out of work.
These forms of social insurance are not targeted specifically at poor people. But they have a large impact on inequality because most retired people and unemployed people would be very poor if they did not receive social insurance payments. In fact, in the European Union, public pensions are the policy with the greatest impact on inequality. They reduce the average Gini coefficient by 0.11, more than all other transfers combined.
Figure 19.28 shows the average household market income and disposable income in the UK in a single year, by age of the households primary earner. Households whose primary earner is less than 25 years old have an average household market income of 24,108 and an average household disposable income of 24,735. The richest group of households is those whose primary earner is aged 4044 years old, and incomes decline rapidly after 6064 years, as primary earners tend to retire. Disposable income is higher than market income for the under-25s and the over-65s, when market income is at its lowest, and conversely for those aged 2564, when household income is at its highest.
If we hypothetically imagine that there is one household at each age group, the Gini coefficient for market income would be 0.249 while for disposable income it would be 0.139the tax and benefit system as a whole reduces inequality because it effectively redistributes from richer households to poorer households. But the figure demonstrates that much of this result could be due to redistribution from those of working age to the retired.

How economists learn from facts What is the best way to give money to the poor? Randomize and find out.
Most countries adopt some policies to raise the living standards of the poor. But what is the best way to do this? If governments would like to transfer funds to individuals or families, should it go to the very poor, or only those who are working, or only those attempting to find work? Should the transfer be given to just the poor, or everyone?
The questions are controversial, and the answers will depend on more than economics. But economists have been using experiments to illuminate at least the costs and benefits of different mechanisms.
Economists have explored the effects of simply giving away cash to the poor, without requiring that they work or make any repayment. In theory, cash payments that one receives whether or not one is employed should have little impact on labour supply. Experiments have found that cash grants are a remarkably cost-effective way of reducing poverty on many dimensions, from increasing consumption to decreasing stress levels. These results have led policymakers to rethink their programs, for example, by comparing the anti-poverty effect of a dollar spent on, say, job training programs, with the effect of simply giving that dollar away.
Some have proposed to expand the cash payment to everyone, not just the poor, in what has been called Unconditional Basic Income Grants (UBI or BIG). Some Silicon Valley groups are funding initial experiments in these more universal cash grants in Oakland, California, randomizing access to cash. Some of them believe that technology is accelerating at such a rate, reducing labour demand to such an extent that universal income grants are going to be needed to keep the vast bulk of humanity from destitute unemployment.
Another proposal in Finland randomly selects betwen 2,000 and 3,000 people to receive monthly lump-sum payments of $600 to see if basic income grants can lower poverty as well as simplify the administration of programs to help the poor. Experimenting with a policy before adopting it wholesale is allowing economists to study some of the effects of particular policies, as well as letting policymakers use evidence to decide whether or not to adopt a policy.

Progressive and regressive redistribution

progressive (policy)An expenditure or transfer that increases the incomes of poorer households by more than richer households, in percentage terms. See also: regressive (policy).regressive (policy)An expenditure or transfer that increases the incomes of richer households by more than poorer households, in percentage terms. See also: progressive (policy).distributionally neutralA policy that is neither progressive or regressive so that it does not alter the distribution of income. See also: progressive (policy), regressive (policy).

When the direct effect of a tax or transfer policy (compared to what would happen in the absence of the policy) is a reduction in inequality, it is called progressive. We have just seen that expenditures are more progressive than taxes. If a policys direct effect is a rise in inequality it is called regressive. Policies that are neither progressive nor regressive are called distributionally neutral.
For an expenditure or transfer to be progressive, it has to increase the incomes of poorer households by more than richer households, in percentage terms. This guarantees that it will reduce the Gini coefficient, and lead to a shift upwards in the Lorenz curve. Note that this policy might mean that in absolute terms (in units of currency), the richer households are receiving more.
Consider Bruno, the landlord, and Angela, the farmer. Suppose that the outcome of their bargaining is that Brunos income is three times as large as Angelas, with Bruno receiving 3,000 pesos per year and Angela receiving 1,000. Suppose also that Angela has two children and Bruno three, all of whom go to publicly funded schools, and that the government spends 200 pesos per year per child. This means that Angela receives in-kind transfers worth 400 pesos per year and Bruno 600. For Angela this implies an increase in her final income of 40%. For Bruno, it is an increase of only 20%. So the transfer is progressive, and the Gini coefficient for final income will decline.
If it seems odd that the Gini will decline even if Bruno receives more than Angela, the explanation is that the Gini coefficient depends on relative incomes, or the ratios of incomes between households. Brunos market income is three times Angelas market income. A policy that reduces that ratio will reduce the Gini coefficient. In the second case above, Brunos final income was 3,600 pesos while Angelas was 1,400, which gives a ratio of 2.57 compared to 3 for market income. Even though Bruno received more in absolute terms, relative inequality between them declined, so the Gini coefficient declined.
Primary schooling is usually very progressive. A case of education expenditure that can be regressive is publicly funded university education. This is because children from richer families are much more likely to go to university. So if Brunos and Angelas children were all of university age, but Brunos children were attending university while Angelas were working, then public university spending would be regressive: Angelas family would receive nothing, while Brunos would receive something.
When it comes to taxes, an analogous principle applies. A tax is progressive if richer households pay a larger share of their incomes than poorer households, and regressive if poorer households pay a larger share of their incomes than richer households. So if Bruno paid 300 pesos in tax and Angela paid 150 pesos, then the tax would be regressive, even though Bruno is paying more in absolute terms: Brunos tax is 10% of his income while Angelas is 15% of hers. Again, this is explained by the effect on the ratio of their incomes. Their after-tax incomes of 2,700 and 850 have a ratio of 3.18, which is higher (more unequal) than the ratio of their market incomes.
Taxes and expenditures can be analysed separately, but it is important to remember that expenditures are only possible because taxes pay for them. When a government spends money on public schools that benefit some households, they are financed by taxes that are paid by all households. This is why fiscal policy is redistributive: all households both give and receive, but some give more than they receive, and vice versa for others. The net effect is to transfer income from some households to other households.
Figures 19.29a and b show the distribution of taxes and public spending in Mexico. Figure 19.29a gives the figures in absolute terms while Figure 19.29b gives them as a percentage of market income. People in the bottom decile each received total benefits worth Mex$6,682 (Mexican pesos) on average per year, compared with Mex$5,557 received by those in the top decile. As Figure 19.29b shows, when represented as a share of market income, these transfers increase the lower the decile, with the bottom decile receiving benefits worth 135% of their market income and the top decile receiving only 13%. Therefore the transfers are progressive, reducing inequality.

For taxes, on average those in the bottom decile paid Mex$594 each, compared with Mex$25,902 for those in the top decile. But since the market incomes of the top decile were 40 times as high as those of the bottom decile, for both groups these taxes represented 12% of income, indicating that taxes are neither regressive nor progressive.
Figure 19.29a shows that the net effect of taxes and transfers is that the lower the decile, the more they receivewith deciles 9 and 10 being net contributors, rather than beneficiaries. This implies that the overall fiscal system is progressive, reducing the Gini coefficient. It also means that fiscal policy effectively redistributes income from the top two deciles (mainly the top decile) to the bottom eight deciles. However, the benefits to deciles 1 through 8 are larger than the cost to deciles 9 and 10. This is partly because the Mexican government also receives revenues from the production of oil. These oil revenues are distributed, but are not redistributedthey represent income the government receives without taxing households and businesses.
Figure 19.29b shows clearly that expenditures are more progressive than taxes: while richer households tend to pay a slightly larger share of income in taxes than poorer households, public expenditures are a much larger share of income for poorer households than richer households.
