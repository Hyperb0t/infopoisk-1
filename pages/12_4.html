12.3 External effects: Policies and income distribution
Suppose in the case of our Weevokil example that Coasean bargaining proves to be impractical, and that the fisherman and plantation owners cannot resolve the Weevokil problem privately. We will continue to assume that it is not possible to grow bananas without using Weevokil. What can the government do to achieve a reduction in the output of bananas to the level that takes into account the costs for the fishermen? There are three ways this might be done:

regulation of the quantity of bananas produced
taxation of the production or sale of bananas
enforcing compensation of the fishermen for the costs imposed on them

Each of these policies has different distributional implications for the fisherman and plantation owners.
Regulation
The government could cap total banana output at 38,000 tonnes, the Pareto-efficient amount. This looks like a straightforward solution. On the other hand, if the plantations differ in size and output, it may be difficult to determine and enforce the right quota for each one.
This policy would reduce the costs of pollution for the fishermen, but it would lower the plantations profits. They would lose their surplus on each tonne of bananas between 38,000 and 80,000.
Taxation
Figure 12.5 shows the MPC and MSC curves again. At the Pareto-efficient quantity (38,000 tonnes), the MSC is $400 and the MPC is $295. The price is $400. If the government puts a tax on each tonne of bananas produced, equal to $400  $295 = $105 (the marginal external cost), then the after-tax price received by plantations will be $295. Now, if plantations maximize their profit, they will choose the point where the after-tax price equals the marginal private cost and produce 38,000 tonnes, the Pareto-efficient quantity. Use the analysis in Figure 12.5 to see how this policy works.

The marginal external cost


At the Pareto-efficient quantity, 38,000 tonnes, the MPC is $295. The MSC is $400. So the marginal external cost is MSC  MPC = $105.














Tax = MSC  MPC


If the government puts a tax on each tonne of bananas produced equal to $105, the marginal external cost, then the after-tax price received by plantations will be $295.














The after-tax price is $295


To maximize profit, the plantations will choose their output so that the MPC is equal to the after-tax price. They will choose point P1 and produce 38,000 tonnes.





Pigouvian taxA tax levied on activities that generate negative external effects so as to correct an inefficient market outcome. See also: external effect, Pigouvian subsidy.external benefitA positive external effect: that is, a positive effect of a production, consumption, or other economic decision on another person or people that is not specified as a benefit in a contract. Also known as: external economy. See also: external effect.

The tax corrects the price message, so that the plantations face the full marginal social cost of their decisions. When the plantations are producing 38,000 bananas, the tax is exactly equal to the cost imposed on the fishermen. This approach is known as a Pigouvian tax, after the economist Arthur Pigou who advocated it. It also works in the case of a positive external effect: if the marginal social benefit of a decision is greater than the marginal private benefit, this becomes a Pigouvian subsidy, which can ensure that the decision-maker takes this external benefit into account.
Leibniz: Pigouvian taxes
The distributional effects of taxation are different from those of regulation. The costs of pollution for fishermen are reduced by the same amount, but the reduction in banana profits is greater, since the plantations pay taxes as well as reducing output, and the government receives tax revenue.
Enforcing compensation
The government could require the plantation owners to pay compensation for costs imposed on the fishermen. The compensation required for each tonne of bananas will be equal to the difference between the MSC and the MPC, which is the distance between the green and purple lines in Figure 12.6. Once compensation is included, the marginal cost of each tonne of bananas for the plantations will be the MPC plus the compensation, which is equal to the MSC. So now the plantations will maximize profit by choosing point P2 in Figure 12.6 and producing 38,000 tonnes. The shaded area shows the total compensation paid. The fishermen are fully compensated for pollution, and the plantations profits are equal to the true social surplus of banana production.

The plantations compensate the fishermen.
        




The effect of this policy on the plantations profits is similar to the effect of the tax, but the fishermen do better because they, rather than the government, receive payment from the plantations.
Diagnosis and treatment in the case of chlordecone
When we identified 38,000 tonnes as the Pareto-efficient level of output in our model, we assumed that growing bananas inevitably involves Weevokil pollution. So our diagnosis was that too many bananas were being produced, and we looked at policies for reducing production. But that was not the case in Guadaloupe and Martinique, where there were alternatives to chlordecone. If alternatives to Weevokil were available, it would be inefficient to restrict output to 38,000 tonnes, because if the plantations could choose a different production method and the corresponding profit-maximizing output, they could be better off, and the fishermen no worse off.
So the problem was caused by the use of chlordecone, not the production of bananas.
The market failure occurred because the price of chlordecone did not incorporate the costs that its use inflicted on the fishermen, and so it sent the wrong message to the firm. Its low price said: use this chemical, it will save you money and raise profits, but if its price had included the full external costs of its use, it might have been high enough to have said: think about the downstream damage, and look for an alternative way to grow bananas.
In this situation, a policy of requiring the plantations to compensate the fishermen would have given them the incentive to find production methods that caused less pollution and could, in principle, have achieved an efficient outcome.
But the other two policies would not do so. Rather than taxing or regulating banana production, it would be better to regulate or tax the sale or the use of chlordecone, to motivate plantations to find the best alternative to intensive chlordecone use.
In theory, if the tax on a unit of chlordecone was equal to its marginal external cost, the price of chlordecone for the plantations would be equal to its marginal social cost, so it would be sending the right message. They could then choose the best production method taking into account the high cost of chlordecone, which would involve reducing its use or switching to a different pesticide, and determine their profit-maximizing output. As with the banana tax, the profits of the plantations and the pollution costs for the fishermen would fall, but the outcome would be better for the plantations, and possibly the fishermen also, if chlordecone rather than bananas were taxed.
Unfortunately, none of these remedies was used for 20 years in the case of chlordecone, and the people of Guadaloupe and Martinique are still living with the consequences. In 1993, the government finally recognized that the marginal social cost of chlordecone use was so high that it should be banned altogether.
In Guadaloupe and Martinique, nothing was done to reduce chlordecone pollution until 1993, although chlordecone was first listed as carcinogenic in 1979. It was obvious that the external costs were much higher than in our case of Weevokil, damaging the health of islanders as well as the livelihood of fishermen. In fact, the marginal social cost of any bananas produced with the aid of chlordecone was higher than their market price, justifying an outright ban on its use. The pollution turned out to be much worse than anyone realized at the time, and is likely to persist in the soil for 700 years. In 2013, fishermen in Martinique barricaded the port of Fort de France until the French government agreed to allocate $2.6 million in aid.
There are limits to how well governments can implement Pigouvian taxes, regulation and compensationoften for the same reasons as for Coasean bargaining:

The government may not know the degree of harm suffered by each fisherman: As a result, it cant create the best compensation policy.
Marginal social costs are difficult to measure: While the plantations marginal private costs are probably well known, it is harder to determine marginal social costs, such as the pollution costs, to either individuals or to society as a whole.
The government may favour the more powerful group: In this case it could impose a Pareto-efficient outcome that is also unfair.


Great economists Arthur Pigou

Arthur Pigou (18771959) was one of the first neoclassical economists to focus on welfare economics, which is the analysis of the allocation of resources in terms of the wellbeing of society as a whole. Pigou won awards during his studies at the University of Cambridge in history, languages, and moral sciences (there was no dedicated economics degree at the time). He became a protg of Alfred Marshall. Pigou was an outgoing and lively person when young, but his experiences as a conscientious objector and ambulance driver during the First World War, as well as anxieties over his own health, turned him into a recluse who hid in his office except for lectures and walks.
Pigous economic theory was mainly focused on using economics for the good of society, which is why he is sometimes seen as the founder of welfare economics.
His book Wealth and Welfare was described by Schumpeter as the greatest venture in labour economics ever undertaken by a man who was primarily a theorist, and provided the foundation for his later work, The Economics of Welfare. Together, these works built up a relationship between a nations economy and the welfare of its people. Pigou focused on happiness and wellbeing. He recognized that concepts such as political freedom and relative status were important.34
Pigou believed that the reallocation of resources was necessary when the interests of a private firm or individual diverged from the interests of society, causing what we would today call externalities. He suggested taxation could solve the problem: Pigouvian taxes are intended to ensure that producers face the true social costs of their decisions.
Despite both being heirs to Marshalls new school of economics, Pigou and Keynes did not see eye-to-eye. Keyness work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, contained a critique of Pigous The Theory of Unemployment, and Pigou felt that Keyness material was becoming too dogmatic and turning students into identical sausages.
The online version of Keyness The General Theory allows you to search for his critique of Pigou: John Maynard Keynes. 1936. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. London: Palgrave Macmillan.
Although overlooked for much of the twentieth century, Pigous work paved the way for much of labour economics and environmental policy. Pigouvian taxes were largely unrecognized until the 1960s, but they have become a major policy tool for reducing pollution and environmental damage.

Now we can extend the table we started to create in Section 12.1 (Figure 12.3). Look at the fifth column in Figure 12.7, which is new: it adds the possible remedies for the problem of negative external effects.

Exercise 12.4 Pigouvian subsidy
Consider the beekeeper and neighbouring farmer in Exercise 12.3. Why might they be unable to bargain successfully to achieve a Pareto-efficient outcome in practice? Use the diagram you drew to show how the government might improve the situation by subsidizing honey production. Describe the distributional effects of this subsidy, and compare it to the Pareto-efficient bargaining outcome.


Exercise 12.5 Comparing policies
Consider the three policies of regulation, taxation, and compensation arrangements discussed above. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each policy from the standpoint of Pareto efficiency and fairness.


Question 12.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
The graph shows the MPC and MSC of robot production for the factory situated next to a dormitory for nurses who work nightshifts.












The market for robots is competitive and the market price is $340. The initial output is 120 but the government uses a Pigouvian tax to reduce this to the efficient level of 80. Which of the following statements is correct?

Under the Pigouvian tax, the factorys surplus will be $6,400.
The required Pigouvian tax is $120 per robot.
The nurses are at least as well off as they would be under Coasean bargaining.
The nurses obtain no benefit from the imposition of the Pigouvian tax.


The Pigouvian tax lowers the after-tax price to $260. The factorys surplus is the area above the MPC line and below the line for a price of $260 = 0.5  80  (260  100) = $6,400.
The Pigouvian tax has to lower the after-tax price from $340 to $260, so it is $80.
Under a Coasean bargain that involved a payment from the factory to the nurses, as well as a reduction in noise, the nurses would be better off.
The nurses do not receive a payment, but they benefit from the noise reduction.
