4.12 Competition in the ultimatum game
Ultimatum game experiments with two players suggest how people may choose to share the rent arising from an economic interaction. But the outcome of a negotiation may be different if it is affected by competition. For example, the professor looking for a research assistant could consider several applicants rather than just one.
Imagine a new version of the ultimatum game in which a Proposer offers a two-way split of $100 to two respondents, instead of just one. If either of the Responders accepts but not the other, that Responder and the Proposer get the split, and the other Responder gets nothing. If no one accepts, no one gets anything, including the Proposer. If both Responders accept, one is chosen at random to receive the split.
If you are one of the Responders, what is the minimum offer you would accept? Are your answers any different, compared to the original ultimatum game with a single Responder? Perhaps. If I knew that my fellow competitor is strongly driven by 5050 split norms, my answer would not be too different. But what if I suspect that my competitor wants the reward very much, or does not care too much about how fair the offer is?
And now suppose you are the Proposer. What split would you offer?
Figure 4.14 shows some laboratory evidence for a large group of subjects playing multiple rounds. Proposers and Responders were randomly and anonymously matched in each round.

The red bars show the fraction of offers that are rejected when there is a single Responder. The blue bars show what happens with two Responders. When there is competition, Responders are less likely to reject low offers. Their behaviour is more similar to what we would expect of self-interested individuals concerned mostly about their own monetary payoffs.
To explain this phenomenon to yourself, think about what happens when a Responder rejects a low offer. This means getting a zero payoff. Unlike the situation in which there is a sole Responder, the Responder in a competitive situation cannot be sure the Proposer will be punished, because the other Responder may accept the low offer (not everyone has the same norms about proposals, or is in the same state of need).
Consequently, even fair-minded people will accept low offers to avoid having the worst of both worlds. Of course, the Proposers also know this, so they will make lower offers, which Responders still accept. Notice how a small change in the rules or the situation can have a big effect on the outcome. As in the public goods game where the addition of an option to punish free riders greatly increased the levels of contribution, changes in the rules of the game matter.

Exercise 4.11 A sequential prisoners dilemma
Return to the prisoners dilemma pest control game that Anil and Bala played in Figure 4.3b, but now suppose that the game is played sequentially, like the ultimatum game. One player (chosen randomly) chooses a strategy first (the first mover), and then the second moves (the second mover).

Suppose you are the first mover and you know that the second mover has strong reciprocal preferences, meaning the second mover will act kindly towards someone who upholds social norms not to pollute and will act unkindly to someone who violates the norm. What would you do?
Suppose the reciprocal person is now the first mover interacting with the person she knows to be entirely self-interested. What do you think would be the outcome of the game?
