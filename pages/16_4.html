Named after the British economist of the same name.

Jobs are created and destroyed by business owners and managers seeking to gain Schumpeterian innovation rents, and in response to the pressure of competition in markets for goods and services. For most workers this means that nothing is permanent: in the course of a lifetime, people move in and out of many jobs (often not by choice). Sometimes people move from job to job, but they move in and out of unemployment too.
In Unit 5, we looked at the decisions of an employer (Bruno) and an employee (Angela) about her work hours and rent. Once Brunos gun was replaced by a legal system and contracts, we saw that taking a job was a voluntary arrangement entered into for mutual gain. The balance of bargaining power may have been unequally distributed but the exchange was, nevertheless, voluntary.
When a worker leaves a job, it may be voluntary, but it can also be an involuntary temporary lay-off (dictated by product demand conditions facing the firm), or a redundancy (the job has been eliminated).
Jobs are also created, as can be seen by the movement of job destruction and creation in the US in Figure 16.5. Job creation is strongly procyclical: this means that it rises in booms, and falls during recessions. Conversely, job destruction is countercyclical: it rises during recessions (if the change in a variable was not correlated with the business cycle, it would be called acyclical). The next section will show how aggregate policies interact with those movements in job flows and worker flows.
This intense job reallocation process and the ability of the government to provide co-insurance led the English economist and politician Lord William Beveridge (18791963) to become the founding father of the UK social security system. He is also remembered among economists because, like Bill Phillips, they bestowed on Beveridge one of their highest honours: they named the Beveridge curve after him.
We met the concept of co-insurance in Unit 13, when we explained how households that have been fortunate during a particular period use their savings to help a household hit by bad luck, and in Unit 14, when we explained how correlated risk limits the usefulness of co-insurance, helping to explain the governments role in providing co-insurance through a system of unemployment benefits.

The Beveridge curve
Beveridge suggested a simple relationship between job vacancy rates (the number of jobs available for workers) and the level of unemployment (the number of workers looking for jobs), expressed as a fraction of the labour force.
Beveridge noticed that when unemployment was high, the vacancy rate was low; and when unemployment was low, the vacancy rate was high:

During recessions, there will be high unemployment: When the demand for a firms product is declining or growing slowly, firms can manage with their current staff even if a few of them quit or retire. As a result, they advertise fewer positions. In the same conditions of weak demand for firms products, people will be laid off or their jobs entirely eliminated.
During booms, unemployment will decline: The number of vacant jobs posted by firms increases, and more workers will be employed to cope with rising demand for products.

The downward-sloping relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate over the business cycle is illustrated in Figure 16.6, which shows two examples of what came to be called the Beveridge curve, using data from Germany and the US. Each dot represents a quarter, from 2001 Q1 until 2015 Q2.

Why are there vacant jobs that are not filled, and unemployed people looking for a job at the same time? We can think of matching being tricky in many parts of life. For example, think of our love lives: how often are we looking for the perfect partner but are unable to find someone suitable?

labour market matchingThe way in which employers looking for additional employees (that is, with vacancies) meet people seeking a new job.

Some factors prevent newly unemployed people from being matched with newly posted jobs (we call this process labour market matching):

A mismatch between the location and nature of the workers looking for jobs and the jobs available for workers: This is sometimes a matter of skills required by firms and the skills of jobseekers. For example, research explains that one of the reasons for inefficiency in the US labour market in recent years has been that vacancies are concentrated in a few industries. The telephone engineer whose job was recently eliminated may not have the computer skills required to fill the vacancies in the companys billing department. Or the redundant workers and the vacancies may be located in different parts of the country. Travelling to another area to find a job would mean severing ties with neighbours, schools, and relatives.
Either jobseekers or those seeking to hire may not have relevant information: As we have seen in Unit 6, economic actors with different skills and needs jobseekers and firms in this examplelook for opportunities for mutual gains from trade. But the firm and the jobseeker may not know about each other (although there is evidence that technology is improving this matching process).5

Matching should be easier when there is a larger pool of the unemployed from which to select. Observing a combination of high unemployment and a large number of vacancies is an indicator of inefficiency in the matching process in the labour market.
Notice three things about the German and American Beveridge curves shown in Figure 16.6:

Both curves slope downward, as expected: The US data oscillates between vacancy rates of about 3% with unemployment rates between 3% and 4% (at the top of the business cycle), to vacancy rates of a little over 2% and unemployment around 6% (at the trough of the cycle).
The position of each nations Beveridge curve is different: The German labour market appears to do a better job of matching workers seeking jobs to firms seeking workers. To see this, notice that the vacancy rate in Germany for every year is lower than in the US for any year, although the two countries experienced a common range of unemployment rates. So, fewer job openings were wasted in Germany.
Both the curves shifted over the course of the decade: The German curve, having established itself over the period 2001 Q1 to 2005 Q1, turned towards the origin and established a new Beveridge curve in the period 2009 Q2 to 2012 Q1. The latter Beveridge curve was closer to the origin, with a smaller sum of the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate than before.

How did this improvement in the German labour market occur? New policies called the Hartz reforms seemed to have worked. Enacted between 2003 and 2005, the Hartz reforms provided more adequate guidance to unemployed workers in finding work and reduced the level of unemployment benefits sooner, so as to provide the unemployed with a stronger motive to search.6
The US curve shifted too, but unlike Germany, conditions deteriorated. For the period 2001 Q1 to 2009 Q2, the US seems as if it is moving along a curve. After that the curve moves out from the origin and then seems to establish a new curve, above and to the right of the older one, suggesting the American labour market became less efficient in matching workers to jobs. Between 2001 and 2008, business-cycle movements displaced workers in all industries all over the country in the usual way, so there wasnt much of a geographical and skills mismatch between workers looking for work and vacant jobs, so why did the Beveridge curve move?

Many redundancies in one industry: The global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, and the recession that followed, particularly affected the housing construction industry. There was a skill-based mismatch between the unemployed and vacancies available.
The collapse of US housing prices: When house prices fell, many homeowners were trapped in a house that was worth less than they had paid for it. They could not sell their house and move to an area with more job vacancies, and this restricted their choice of jobs.7

The result was that the economy moved to a situation where, for a given level of vacancies, there was a higher rate of unemployment.

Exercise 16.3 Beveridge curves and the German labour market
According to the Beveridge curves, the German labour market does a better job at matching workers with job openings, but over some intervals (for example, 2001 Q1 to 2005 Q1), average unemployment in Germany in Figure 16.6 was higher than in the US.
Consider the possible role of aggregate demand (Section 13.2 on Okun law, and Section 14.10 on aggregate demand and unemployment). What kind of data could be used to find support for your hypothesis?


Question 16.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
The graph shows the plot of Beveridge curves for the US and Germany for the period 2001 Q1 to 2015 Q2. Based on this information, which of the statements below is correct?













The Beveridge curves depict the negative relationship between the vacancy rate and the employment rate.
The US labour market was better at matching workers with vacancies during the financial crisis of 20089.
The US Beveridge curve shifted after the financial crisis, improving the matching rate.
The matching rate in Germany improved after its Beveridge curve shifted around 2007.


Beveridge curves depict the relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate.
During the global financial crisis, the same vacancy rate was associated with a higher level of unemployment, indicating greater inefficiency in the matching process.
The rightward shift of the US Beveridge curve suggests that the matching process became less efficient.
The German Beveridge curve shifted to the left over time, meaning that the same vacancy rate was associated with a lower level of unemployment. The matching process therefore became more efficient.
