18.1 Globalization and deglobalization in the long run

merchandise tradeTrade in tangible products that are physically shipped across borders.

The trade in goods, sometimes called merchandise trade, concerns tangible products that are physically shipped across borders by road, rail, water, or air. Trade of this sort has been happening for millennia, although the nature of the goods traded, and the distances over which they have been shipped, have changed dramatically. Trade in services is a more recent phenomenon, although it has also been occurring for centuries. Services that are commonly traded across borders are tourism, financial services, and legal advice. Many traded services make merchandise trade easier or cheaperfor example, shipping services, or insurance and financial services.
The UK became the leading provider of these services during the nineteenth century, when it was the most advanced industrial economy, the major naval and imperial power, and the most important trading nation. Nowadays, countries also export educational services (for example, people travel from all over the world to study in US or European universities), consulting services, and medical services. India has become a major exporter of software-related services. For example, the ebook for the CORE project was initially developed in Bangalore. We will study these service exports together with merchandise trade, since the same principles can help us to understand them.
How can we measure the extent of globalization in goods and services? One approach would simply be to measure the amount of trade in a country or region, or the world as a whole, over time. If it increased, we conclude that the country, region or the whole world was becoming more globalized. It is common to measure trends in the share of imports, exports, or total trade (imports plus exports) in GDP as an indicator of globalization, so as to take account of the growth of GDP as well as trade.
Figure 18.2 shows world merchandise exports (which excludes services), expressed as a share of world GDP, between 1820 and 2011. The share rose by a factor of 8 between 1820 and 1913, from 1% to 8%. In 1950, the share was lower (5.5%) but recovered rapidly during the prosperous postwar period. It reached 10.5% in 1973, 17% in 1998, and 26% in 2011. In the long run, the trend has clearly been upwards, with a sharp acceleration from the 1990s onwards. However, this trend was interrupted between 1914 and 1945, which included two world wars and the Great Depression.

law of one priceHolds when a good is traded at the same price across all buyers and sellers. If a good were sold at different prices in different places, a trader could buy it cheaply in one place and sell it at a higher price in another. See also: arbitrage.price gapA difference in the price of a good in the exporting country and the importing country. It includes transportation costs and trade taxes. When global markets are in competitive equilibrium, these differences will be entirely due to trade costs. See also: arbitrage.

A second method is to measure the additional costs associated with exporting goods relative to selling them domestically. When the costs of trading between countries fall, then in economic terms, the world has shrunk. It is as if countries were closer. In Unit 8, you learned about Alfred Marshall and his model of supply and demand. We saw that the law of one price holds in markets with many potential buyers and sellers, where all goods are identical and where buyers and sellers are aware of all trading opportunities. But this assumes that it is costless to take advantage of those trading opportunities. If, on the other hand, trading between markets in two countries is costly because of transport costs, trade barriers, or other factors, then there is no reason to suppose that prices will be the same in both.
Consider the market for a good that is produced in (and exported from) one country and consumed in (and imported into) another. Lets use the example of Japan exporting cars to the US. To keep the analysis straightforward, imagine that these are the two only countries in the world, that the Japanese do not consume cars, and that the US does not produce any cars itself. This means that everything that is produced is traded. The blue line in Figure 18.3 represents the supply curve in Japan: it is an upward-sloping function of the price in Japan. The red line represents the demand curve in the US. It is a downward-sloping function of the price in that country.
Let t be the cost of shipping a car from Japan to the US, including all transportation costs, trade taxes and so on. If the market is competitive, then the total cost of obtaining a car in the US will be the cost of buying it in Japan, plus the trade cost t. t is a measure of the price gap between cars in Japan and cars in the US. Follow the analysis in Figure 18.3 to see how changes in trade costs are reflected in price gaps.












Figure 18.3 
The market for cars: Price gaps reflect trade costs.
        















The exporters supply curve


The blue line represents the supply curve in the producing (exporting) country, which is Japan. It is an upward-sloping function of the price in that country.














The consumers demand curve


The red line represents the demand curve in the consuming (importing) country, which is the US. It is a downward-sloping function of the price in that country.














A competitive market


If the market is competitive, then the price of the car in the US will be the cost of buying it in Japan, plus the trade cost t. Let us assume that the cost of shipping a unit of the good is 4.5. We will show that 4,000 cars will be produced.














Why 4,000?


Because at that quantity, the difference between the supply curve and the demand curve is equal to the trade cost, 4.5. The marginal cost in Japan will be 2.75, while the customers in the US are willing to pay 7.25 per unit.














The effect of globalization


If we think of globalization as a process, then a world that is becoming more globalized is one in which trade costs are falling. In the figure, this is represented by a decline in trade costs from t to t.














The price gap declines


As can be seen, falling trade costs imply a decline in the price gap between the import price and the export price, and an increase in the number of cars traded from 4,000 to 6,000.





In the right circumstances, globalization can benefit both exporting producers and importing consumers.
It does so by bringing them closer together, and it leads to an increase in both the supply of exports and the demand for imports.


arbitrageThe practice of buying a good at a low price in a market to sell it at a higher price in another. Traders engaging in arbitrage take advantage of the price difference for the same good between two countries or regions. As long as the trade costs are lower than the price gap, they make a profit. See also: price gap.

The concept of arbitrage explains why the price gap should tend to equal the sum of all trade costs. By buying at a low price in export markets and selling at a higher price in import markets, traders can make a profit as long as the price gap is higher than the total costs of trade. When traders engage in arbitrage in this fashion, they lower the supply of the good in the export market, driving up its price, and they increase the supply of the good in the import market, lowering its price. Both of these effects cause the price gap to decline. This should continue until price gaps have been driven down to the trade cost, and further arbitrage is unprofitable. A high price gap reflects a world in which trade is expensive and globalization is limited. A low price gap, on the other hand, reflects a much more globalized world in which trade is cheap.
This means we can learn about globalization from data on prices:

Globalization should lead to falling import prices: But if we observe falling import prices, this does not necessarily mean that globalization is occurring. The demand for the good in question may simply have declined (or the supply may have increased).
Globalization should also lead to rising export prices: But rising export prices do not necessarily imply globalization. Demand for the good in question may simply be rising (or the supply may have declined).
Declining price gaps between importing and exporting countries are a much surer sign of globalization: This is particularly true if we can also observe rising trade volumes.

For example, Figure 18.4 shows unmistakable evidence of declining transatlantic trade costs during the nineteenth century. The wheat price gap between the UK and the US (expressed as a percentage) fluctuated wildly before 1840 or so, around a roughly constant trend. It then started to decline at about the same time that shipping costs started to fall, a result of the introduction of steamships on long-distance routes. The price gap had almost vanished by 1914. At the same time, the volume of wheat shipped across the Atlantic rose dramatically.

The transatlantic trade in wheat is not an isolated example. International price gaps fell sharply on many routes and for many commodities between 1815 and 1914, the first epoch of modern globalization.
Figure 18.5 gives American-Anglo price gaps (the reverse of Figure 18.4) for a variety of commodities between 1870 and 1913. For agricultural commodities such as wheat and animal products, British prices were higher than American ones, so the price gaps are the percentage by which the British price exceeded the American price. In the case of industrial commodities such as cotton textiles or iron bars, American prices were higher than British ones, so the price gaps quoted are the percentage by which prices in Boston or Philadelphia exceeded prices in Manchester or London. In nearly all cases price gaps fell (sugar is the outstanding exception), indicating that transatlantic commodity markets were becoming better integrated. Much like the dramatic reduction in grain prices in Genoa after the opening of the Suez Canal, which we discussed in the introduction to this unit, price gaps between the US and the UK reduced over time because of a revolution in transportation and improvements in farming and production technology. This is hardly an isolated example. There exists evidence of similar convergence for Liverpool-Bombay cotton, London-Calcutta jute, and London-Rangoon rice prices.

Railways were probably even more important than steamships in integrating global commodity markets. Without them, it would have been prohibitively expensive to ship grain and other goods to and from the interior of continents and coastal seaports. Where price gaps fell less sharply during the late nineteenth century, this was often because of tariffstaxes on importswhich were rising in several countries for reasons that we will discuss later, and which counteracted the effects of declining transport costs.

protectionist policyMeasures taken by a government to limit trade; in particular, to reduce the amount of imports in the economy. These are designed to protect local industries from external competition. They can take different forms, such as taxes on imported goods or import quotas.quotaA limit imposed by the government on the volume of imports allowed to enter the economy during a specific period of time.

Transatlantic shipments of wheat fell after 1914, and price gaps rose, suggesting a rise in trade costs and therefore deglobalization. International price gaps rose during the interwar period for many agricultural commodities, because governments raised tariffs in response to unemployment and economic insecurity. When a country undertakes protectionist policies, its government is taking steps to limit trade, in particular by reducing the amount of imports coming into the economy. This is often done to protect domestic industries against foreign competition (hence protectionism), but it also means consumers have to pay more for imports. Protectionist measures include taxes to raise the domestic price of imports (a tariff) and quantitative restrictions on imports (a quota).
The post-1945 period was one of reglobalization, which began slowly but then accelerated, especially after 1990. Agricultural markets were largely protected for much of the period, and there is no reason to suppose that international price gaps for agricultural commodities fell sharply. The markets for industrial goods and components, on the other hand, were liberalized, and several studies have found evidence of declining international price gaps in the late twentieth century.
Economists have measured trade costs indirectly, by looking at trade between pairs of countries. This shows the long-term changes in impediments to trade, and can separate the effects of distance between the countries from national policies of those countries. If trade between Germany and France, for example, increased from one year to the next, but it did not increase between these two countries and their other trading partners at the same time, we can interpret this as an indirect measure of declining trade costs for this pair of countries.
If we sum total trade costs each year for all major economies, we have an indicator of the process of globalization. Figures 18.6 and 18.7 do this for the period 1870 to 2000.

Trade costs declined substantially from 1870 to 1913, reflecting declining transport costs and reductions in tariffs. Trade costs then rose in the interwar period because of rising tariffs. This was particularly the case following the onset of the Great Depression in 1929: countries attempted to solve unemployment problems by discouraging imports.
From 1970, trade costs started to fall worldwide again as countries began to reliberalize trade, and transport technologies improved. Tariffs tend to be higher in low-income countries than in rich countries, in part because alternative methods of raising government revenue such as the income tax are difficult to administer in developing countries. As Figure 18.7 shows, however, most countries have reduced their tariffs in recent decades.

Globalization I and IITwo separate periods of increasing global economic integration: the first extended from before 1870 until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the second extended from the end of the Second World War into the twenty-first century. See also: globalization.

The price evidence therefore suggests interrupted commodity market integration over the past 150 years. Nineteenth century integration was briefly reversed, followed by reintegration after the Second World War. We call these two periods of integration Globalization I and Globalization II.

Exercise 18.1 Price gaps that did and didnt fall
Figure 18.5 shows the price gap of different commodities between the US and UK over time. Can you think of a reason why price gaps for meat and animal fats such as butter did not start to fall until 1895? Propose an explanation for the smaller price gaps and the more rapid fall for copper as compared with iron ore. What might account for the increase in the price gap for sugar?


Exercise 18.2 Learning more about tariffs
Download the data set, Tariff rate, applied, weighted mean, all products, 19882017, by going to the World Bank website and clicking EXCEL (listed under the Download section on the right). This data was used to produce Figure 18.7.

Choose one country from each income category (high, low, lower middle, upper middle) and plot the evolution of tariffs in these four countries. Use your plots to describe how tariffs in your chosen countries have changed over time.
Evidence from other studies suggests that on average, tariffs tend to be higher in lower-income countries than in high-income countries, but that most countries have reduced tariffs substantially in recent decades. Do your plots support this claim? Suggest an explanation for some of the observed differences between your chosen countries (if any). (As a starting point you may want to consider your chosen countries membership of global trade agreements such as GATT/WTO or the EU, and also whether the country has followed the structural adjustment programs of the IMF).



Question 18.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.3 depicts the supply curve in the exporting country and the demand curve in the importing country in a market for a traded good. Assume that the good is produced exclusively in the exporting country and consumed exclusively in the importing country.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

At quantity 4,000, the price received by the producers is 7.25.
At quantity 6,000, the price paid by the consumer is 4.
The price gap represents the trade costs, such as transportation costs and trade taxes.
Increasing the quantity sold to 6,000 causes the price gap to fall to 2.


The price received by the producers is the price paid minus the trade costs. At quantity 4,000, this is 2.75.
The price paid by the consumers at quantity 6,000 is 6.
Due to arbitrage, the price difference must represent trade costs.
The causality is the other way round. If the trade costs were 2, the quantity traded would be 6,000.



Question 18.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.6 is a graph of an index that represents trade costs. A higher index represents higher trade costs and less globalization. Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?

The graph suggests a consistent decline in trade costs since 1870.
Attempts by countries to address their unemployment problems after the 1929 Great Depression seem to have led to a decline in globalization.
There does not seem to be any evidence of increased globalization after the Second World War.
The graph suggests that commodity market integration over the past 150 years was one of interrupted integration.


There is a period between the two World Wars when the trade costs seem to have increased.
After 1929 countries sought to protect their economies by placing tariffs on imports.
There is a downward trend in the impediments to trade index after the Second World War.
We see an overall downward trend in trade costs, with the notable exception of the interwar period.
