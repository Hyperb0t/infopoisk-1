How credit, money, and banks expand opportunities for mutual gain, and the factors that limit their capacity to accomplish this

People can rearrange the timing of their spending by borrowing, lending, investing, and saving.
While mutual gains motivate credit market transactions, there is a conflict of interest between borrowers and lenders over the rate of interest, the prudent use of loaned funds, and their repayment.
Borrowing and lending is a principalagent relationship, in which the lender (the principal) cannot guarantee repayment of the loan by the borrower (the agent) by means of an enforceable contract.
To solve this problem, lenders often require borrowers to contribute some of their own funds to a project.
As a result, people with limited wealth are sometimes unable to secure loans, or can only do so at higher interest rates.
Money is a medium of exchange consisting of bank notes and bank deposits, or anything else that can be used to purchase goods and services, and is accepted as payment because others can use it for the same purpose.
Banks are profit-maximizing firms that create money in the form of bank deposits in the process of supplying credit.
A nations central bank creates a special kind of money called legal tender and lends to banks at its chosen policy interest rate.
The interest rate charged by banks to borrowers (firms and households) is largely determined by the policy interest rate chosen by the central bank.

The market town of Chambar in southeastern Pakistan serves as the financial centre for 2,400 farmers in surrounding villages. At the beginning of the kharif-planting season in April, when they sow cotton and other cash crops, they will buy fertilizer and other inputs. Months have passed since they sold the last harvest and so the only way they can buy inputs is to borrow, promising to repay at the next harvest. Others borrow to pay for medicines or doctors. But few of them have ever walked through the shiny glass and steel doors of the JS Bank on Hyderabad Road. Instead, they visit one of approximately 60 moneylenders.
If they are seeking a first-time loan, they will be questioned intensively by the moneylender, asked for references from other farmers known to the lender, and in most cases given a small trial loan as a test of creditworthiness. The lender will probably visit to investigate the condition of the farmers land, animals, and equipment.1

collateralAn asset that a borrower pledges to a lender as a security for a loan. If the borrower is not able to make the loan payments as promised, the lender becomes the owner of the asset.

The lenders are right to be wary. If the farmers crop fails due to the farmers lack of attention, the lender loses money. Unlike many financial institutions, lenders do not usually require that the farmer set aside some property or belongings (called collateral) that would become the lenders property if the farmer were unable to repay the loanfor example, some gold jewelry.
If the would-be first-time borrower looks reliable or trustworthy enough, he will be offered a loan. In Chambar, this is at an average interest rate of 78% per annum. If the borrower is paying the loan back in four months (the growing period of the crop prior to harvest), 100 rupees borrowed before planting will be paid back as 126 rupees. Knowing that more than half the loan applications are refused, the borrower would consider himself fortunate.
And indeed he would be, at least compared to some people 12,000 km away in New York, who take out short-term loans to be repaid when their next paycheck comes in. These payday loans bear interest rates ranging from 350% to 650% per annum, much higher than the legal maximum interest rate in New York (25%). In 2014, the payday syndicate offering these loans was charged with criminal usury in the first degree.2
Given the interest rate, is lending in Chambar likely to be exceptionally profitable? The evidence suggests it is not. Some of the funds lent to farmers are borrowed from commercial banks like the JS Bank at interest rates averaging 32% per annum, representing a cost to the moneylenders. And the costs of the extensive screening and collection of the debts further reduces the profits made by the lenders.
Partly as a result of the careful choices made by the moneylenders, default is rare: fewer than one in 30 borrowers fail to repay. By contrast, default rates on loans made by commercial banks are much higher: one in three. The moneylenders success in avoiding default is based on their accurate assessment of the likely trustworthiness of their clients.
Money and trust are more closely related than you might think.
On 4 May 1970, a notice appeared in the Irish Independent newspaper in the Republic of Ireland, titled Closure of Banks. It read:

As a result of industrial action by the Irish Bank Officials Association it is with regret that these banks must announce the closure of all their offices in the Republic of Ireland from 1 May, until further notice.

Banks in Ireland did not open again until 18 November, six-and-a-half months later.
Did Ireland fall off a financial cliff? To everyones surprise, instead of collapsing, the Irish economy continued to grow much as before. A two-word answer has been given to explain how this was possible: Irish pubs. Andrew Graham, an economist, visited Ireland during the bank strike and was fascinated by what he saw:

Because everyone in the village used the pub, and the pub owner knew them, they agreed to accept deferred payments in the form of cheques that would not be cleared by a bank in the near future. Soon they swapped one persons deferred payment with another thus becoming the financial intermediary. But there were some bad calls and some pubs took a hit as a result. My second experience is that I made a payment with a cheque drawn on an English bank (1 equalled 1 Irish punt at the time) and, out of curiosity, on my return to England, I rang the bank (in those days you could speak to someone you knew in a bank) and they told me my cheque had duly been paid in but that on the back were several signatures. In other words, it had been passed on from one person to another exactly as if it were money.

The Irish bank closures are a vivid illustration of the definition of money: it is anything accepted in payment. At that time, notes and coins made up about one-third of the money in the Irish economy, with the remaining two-thirds in bank deposits. The majority of transactions used cheques, but paying by cheque requires banks to ensure that people have the funds to back up their paper payments.
In a functioning banking system the cheque is cashed at the end of the day, and the bank credits the current account of the shop. If the writer of the cheque does not have enough money to cover the amount, the bank bounces the cheque, and the shop owner knows immediately that he has to collect in some other way. People generally avoid writing bad cheques as a result.
Credit or debit cards were not yet widely used. Today, a debit card works by instantly verifying the balance of your bank account and debiting from it. If you get a loan to buy a car, the bank credits your current account and you then write a cheque, use a credit or debit card, or initiate a bank transfer to the car dealer to buy the car. This is money in a modern economy.
So what happens when the banks close their doors and everyone knows that cheques will not bounce, even if the cheque writer has no money? Will anyone accept your cheques? Why not just write a cheque to buy the car when there is not enough money in your current account or in your approved overdraft? If you start thinking like this, you would not trust someone offering you a cheque in exchange for goods or services. You would insist on being paid in cash. But there is not enough cash in circulation to finance all of the transactions that people need to make. Everyone would have to cut back, and the economy would suffer.
How did Ireland avoid this fate? As we have seen, it happened at the pub. Cheques were accepted in payment as money, because of the trust generated by the pub owners. Publicans (owners of the pubs) spend hours talking and listening to their patrons. They were prepared to accept cheques, which could not be cleared in the banking system, as payment from those judged to be trustworthy. During the six-month period that the banks were closed, about 5 billion of cheques were written by individuals and businesses, but not processed by banks. It helped that Ireland had one pub for every 190 adults at the time. With the assistance of pub and shop owners who knew their customers, cheques could circulate as money. With money in bank accounts inaccessible, the citizens of Ireland created the amount of new money needed to keep the economy growing during the bank closure.34
Irish publicans and the moneylenders in the market town of Chambar would perhaps not recognize, among the many things they had in common, that they were creating money, and they would not know that in doing so they were providing a service essential to the functioning of their respective economies.5
Not everyone passes the trustworthiness tests set by pub owners and moneylenders, of course. And, in Chambar and New York, some of those who do pay much higher interest rates than others.
