14.2 The multiplier model

consumption (C)Expenditure on consumer goods including both short-lived goods and services and long-lived goods, which are called consumer durables.investment (I)Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (machinery and equipment) and buildings, including new housing.

We begin with a simple model that excludes the government and foreign trade. In this model, there are two types of expenditure:

consumption
investment

We assume that aggregate consumption spending has two parts:

A fixed amount: How much people will spend, independent of their income. This fixed amount, also known as autonomous consumption, is shown as c0 on the vertical axis of Figure 14.2.
A variable amount: This depends on current income, and is an upward-sloping red line in Figure 14.2.


autonomous consumptionConsumption that is independent of current income.

So we can write consumption spending in the form of an equation, which we call the aggregate consumption function:


marginal propensity to consume (MPC)The change in consumption when disposable income changes by one unit.

The term c1 gives the effect of one additional unit of income on consumption, called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). In Figure 14.2, the slope of the consumption line is equal to the marginal propensity to consume. A steeper consumption line means a larger consumption response to a change in income. A flatter line means that households are smoothing their consumption so that it does not vary much when their incomes change. We assume that the marginal propensity to consume is positive, but less than one. This means that only part of an increase in income is consumed; the rest is saved.

The aggregate consumption function.
        















Autonomous consumption


This is the fixed amount that households will spend that does not depend on their current level of income.














Consumption that depends on income


The upward-sloping line denotes the part of consumption that depends on current income (and hence on current output).














The marginal propensity to consume


The slope of the consumption line is equal to the marginal propensity to consume.




We will work with an aggregate consumption function in which the marginal propensity to consume, c1, equals 0.6. This means that an additional unit of income (Euros in this case) increases consumption by 1 0.6 =60 cents.
Naturally, this average number hides large variation across households, who differ in their wealth and in the credit constraints they face. Most households have little wealth, and even in rich countries about one in four households are credit-constrained. As we saw in Unit 13, weakness of will also plays a role. So, both for households that are credit-constrained and for those that do not save ahead of anticipated declines in income, consumption closely tracks income.
Households with low wealth smooth consumption very little if their income falls sharply. The marginal propensity to consume for this group is closer to 0.8. For the small fraction of households who hold the majority of wealth, however, current income plays a very small role in determining consumption, and their marginal propensity to consume is closer to zero. This means that for rich households, an increase in current income of 1 would raise their consumption by just a few cents.
The term c0 in the aggregate consumption function captures all the other influences on consumption that are not related to current income. Taken literally, it is how much a person with no income would consume, but this is not the best way to think about it. It is just the consumption that is independent of income, and for this reason we call it autonomous consumption.
Since the consumption function only explicitly includes current income, expectations about future income will be included in autonomous consumption. To see what this means in practice, recall from Unit 13 that consumption will change as a result of people becoming more or less optimistic about their future employment and earnings prospects.
Figure 14.3 illustrates how expectations affected consumption in the financial crisis of 2008 and highlights the exceptional nature of this episode. The figure shows how consumer confidence changed in the US over the course of the crisis. The consumer sentiment index that we have used is the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. It is based on monthly interviews with 500 households, and asks how they view prospects for their own financial situation and for the general economy over the short and long term. The figure also plots the evolution of a number of key macroeconomic indicators: disposable income, consumption of durable goods like cars and home furnishings, and consumption of non-durable goods, such as food. All of the series in Figure 14.3 are shown as index numbers, with the first quarter of 2008 as the base year.

We notice:

Consumption of non-durable goods went down slightly more than disposable income: It fell by 3% during the period. Contrary to the predictions of consumption smoothing, households were sufficiently worried about their future prospects that they made adjustments to their spending on non-durables.
Consumption of durables decreased much more dramatically than disposable income: It decreased by 10% in the first year.

Why the sudden drop in consumption of consumer durables? An important reason is that households were suddenly fearful about the future of their jobs, as shown by the sharp decline in the consumer sentiment index in Figure 14.3. The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008, worries about the stability of the banking system, and a higher burden of household debt due to falling house prices led households with mortgages to postpone purchases of expensive items like cars and fridges. Its important to remember that spending on consumer durables can easily be postponed. In this sense it is more like an investment than a consumption decision (even though consumer durables are counted as part of consumption in the national accounts). As a result, we would expect the series for consumer durables to be more volatile than for non-durable consumption.
We now show how a shock is transmitted through the economy. In Figure 14.4 we show the amount of output produced by the economy (on the horizontal axis) and the demand for output (on the vertical axis). Everything is measured in real terms because we are interested in how changes in aggregate demand create changes in output and employment.












Figure 14.4 
Goods market equilibrium: The multiplier diagram.
        















Goods market equilibrium


Point A is called a goods market equilibrium: the economy will continue producing at that output level unless something changes spending behaviour.














The 45-degree line


The 45-degree line from the origin of the diagram shows all the combinations in which output is equal to aggregate demand, meaning the economy is in goods market equilibrium.














Consumption


The first component of aggregate demand is consumption, which is represented by the consumption line introduced in Figure 14.2.














Investment


Adding investment to the consumption line simply leads to a parallel upward shift of the aggregate demand line.




The 45-degree line from the origin of the diagram shows all the combinations in which output is equal to aggregate demand. This corresponds to the circular flow discussed in Unit 13, where we saw that spending on goods and services in the economy (aggregate demand) is equal to production of goods and services in the economy (aggregate output). You can see this because with a 45-degree line the horizontal distance (output) is equal to the vertical distance (aggregate demand). We can therefore say that:


goods market equilibriumThe point at which output equals the aggregate demand for goods produced in the home economy. The economy will continue producing at this output level unless something changes spending behaviour. See also: aggregate demand.capacity utilization rateA measure of the extent to which a firm, industry, or entire economy is producing as much as the stock of its capital goods and current knowledge would allow.

But how do we know where the economy is on the 45-degree line? Is it at a position of low output, which would mean high unemployment, or is it at a position of high output, which would mean low unemployment?
We determine this position by analysing the individual components of aggregate demand. We assume that firms are willing to supply any amount of the goods demanded by those making purchases in the economy; they are not operating at full capacity utilization. Because we have assumed that there is no government spending or trade with other economies, in this model there are just two components of aggregate spending:

Consumption: We take the consumption line introduced in Figure 14.2. Because the marginal propensity to consume is less than one, the consumption line is flatter than the 45-degree line, which has a slope of one.
Investment: We assume investment does not depend on the level of output.

The equation for aggregate demand is therefore:

So adding investment to the consumption line simply leads to a parallel upward shift. In this respect, investment is similar to autonomous consumption. We can see from Figure 14.4 that the aggregate demand line has an intercept of c0 + I, a slope of c1, and is flatter than the 45-degree line.
In Figure 14.4 we now have a picture showing how the level of output in the economy is determined. Output is equal to aggregate demand (the 45-degree line), and aggregate demand is equal to c0 + c1Y + I (the flatter line), so the economy must be at point A where the two lines cross.
The same figure tells us the effect of a change in autonomous consumption (c0) or investment. We study this change exactly as we did the changes in supply and demand in Unit 11: we see how the change makes the old outcome no longer an equilibrium, and then we locate the new equilibrium. The expected change is the movement from the old to the new equilibrium.
Changes in autonomous consumption or investment displace the old equilibrium because they change aggregate demand, which in turn alters the level of output and employment. In Figure 14.5, we take the multiplier diagram and reduce investment. We choose a reduction in investment of 1.5 billion. Follow the steps in Figure 14.5 to see what happens.












Figure 14.5 
The multiplier in action: An investment-led recession.
        















Goods market equilibrium


The economy starts at point A, in goods market equilibrium.














A fall in investment


The fall in investment cuts aggregate demand by 1.5 billion, and the economy moves vertically downward from point A to point B.














Firms cut back


With demand lower, firms cut back production and reduce employment. With output and employment lower, incomes fall by 1.5 billion. This is the move from B to C.














A fall in consumption


Once households incomes fall, they reduce their consumption, because they may be credit-constrained. The consumption equation tells us that this kind of behaviour initially leads to a fall in aggregate consumption of 0.6 times the fall in income. This is the distance from point C to point D.














Firms cut back again


Firms respond by cutting production, output falls, and the economy moves from point D to point E.














 and so on


The process will go on until the economy reaches point Z.














The new aggregate demand line


This goes through point Z and shows the new goods market equilibrium of the economy following the investment shock.














The fall in output as a result of the shock


The total fall in output exceeds the initial size of the decline in investment; output has fallen by 3.75 billion.














The multiplier is equal to 2.5


The total change in output is 2.5 times larger than the initial change in investment.




We trace the effect of the fall in investment through the economy in Figure 14.5. The first-round effect is that the fall in investment cuts aggregate demand by 1.5 billion. But lower spending also means lower production and lower incomes, and firms will fire workers as a result, leading to a further decline in spending. Think of credit-constrained households where some members lose their job: they would like to keep consumption stable, but when their income falls they are unable to borrow enough to sustain that level of consumption, so they reduce their spending, which leads to further cuts in production and incomes. The consumption equation tells us that this kind of behaviour leads to a fall in aggregate consumption of 0.6 times the fall in income. The process will go on until the economy reaches point Z.
Following the investment shock, the intercept of the line has moved down by 1.5 billion, causing a parallel shift in the aggregate demand line. Output has fallen by 3.75billion, more than the fall in investment of 1.5 billion: this is the multiplier process.
In this case, the multiplier is equal to 2.5, because the total change in output is 2.5 times larger than the initial change in investment. A multiplier of 2.5 is unrealistically large. As we shall see in the next section, once taxes and imports are introduced in the model, the multiplier shrinks.

multiplier modelA model of aggregate demand that includes the multiplier process. See also: fiscal multiplier, multiplier process.

We call the model of aggregate demand that includes the multiplier process the multiplier model. This is a summary:

A fall in demand leads to a fall in production and an equivalent fall in income: This leads to a further (smaller) fall in demand, which leads to a further fall in production, and so on.
The multiplier is the sum of all these successive decreases in production: Eventually, output has fallen by a larger amount than the initial shift in demand. Output is a multiple of the initial shift.
Production adjusts to demand: Firms supply the amount of goods demanded at the prevailing price. When demand falls, firms adjust production down. The model assumes that they do not adjust their prices.

Note that the economy we are studying is one in which we assume there are underutilized resources in the form of spare capacity in production facilities and underemployed labour. We also assume that wages are not affected by changes in the level of output. For the multiplier process to work in the same way in response to a rise in investment, the assumption of spare capacity and fixed wages means that costs will not rise when output goes up, so firms will be happy to supply the extra output demanded without adjusting their prices. Otherwise some of the increased spending will translate into higher prices or wages rather than higher real outputas we discuss in the next unit.
If the economy is not characterized by spare capacity and constant wages, the multiplier will be smaller than what we find here.
We can also show the effect on output by combining the two equations that determine the lines in the multiplier diagram. The 45-degree line is simply the equation Y = AD. Combining this with the equation for AD givesus:

Collecting terms on the left hand side,

We then divide through by (1  c1):


autonomous demandComponents of aggregate demand that are independent of current income.

We can now calculate how much output will increase or decrease using the value of the multiplier times the change in autonomous demand.
Discover another way to summarize our findings from the diagram algebraically in the Einstein at the end of this section.
The change in output in Figure 14.5 is 2.5 times greater than the initial shock to investment, which means that the shock has been amplified. In algebra, we write this as Y = kI, and say it as delta Y (the change in output) is equal to k, the multiplier, times delta I (the change in investment).

Question 14.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 14.2 depicts a consumption function of an economy, where C is the aggregate consumption spending and Y is the current income of the economy.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of current income spent on consumption, C/Y.
The MPC is given by the lines intercept on the vertical axis.
The MPC is normally less than 1 as some households are able to smooth their consumption.
If the current income of a country is Y = $100 trillion and the MPC = 0.6, then the aggregate consumption spending is C = $60 trillion.


The MPC is the proportion of the additional income received that is spent on consumption. Here it is given by c1. C/Y is the average propensity to consume.
The slope of the line gives the MPC.
Households that smooth consumption will increase spending by less than the amount their income increases.
C is c0 + c1Y, that is, $60 trillion plus the fixed (or autonomous) consumption c0.



Question 14.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram depicts the change in the aggregate goods market equilibrium when there is a 2 billion increase in investment.












The economys marginal propensity to consume is 0.5. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The new goods market equilibrium after the investment increase is E.
Aggregate demand increases by a total of 2 billion  0.5 = 1 billion due to the increase in investment.
The multiplier is 2.
The distance between C and D is three-quarters the distance between A and B (1.5 billion).


The equilibrium is where the aggregate consumption line intersects with the 45-degree line. Therefore the new equilibrium is Z.
The diagram shows that the increase in investment results in a 4 billion increase in aggregate demand.
The multiplier is equal to 1/(1  0.5) = 2.
The distance between A and B is the initial increase in investment of 2 billion. At C, the output Y has increased by 2 billion compared with B, which results in an increase in the aggregate demand of Y (change in Y)  MPC, that is, 2 billion  0.5 = 1 billion.



Einstein Calculating the multiplier
We consider the effect of an increase in investment of 1.5 billion. We can summarize our findings from the multiplier diagram by doing some algebra. To get the multiplier, we can calculate the total increase in production after n + 1 rounds of the process. Each round of the process matches the circular flow diagram. The first-round increase in demand and production is 1.5 billion. The second-round increase in demand and production is (c1  1.5 billion), the third-round increase in demand and production is c1  (c1  1.5 billion) = (c12  1.5 billion), and so on.
Following this logic, the total increase in demand and production after n + 1 rounds is the total sum of these changes:

Because the marginal propensity to consume is lower than one, we can show that the total sum in the brackets reaches a limit of 1/(1  c1) as n gets large. This is because the term in the brackets is, mathematically, a geometric series. We show this as follows.
If k is the multiplier, we have:

Now multiply both sides by (1  c1) to get:

Now divide again by (1  c1):

As n gets large, assuming c1 < 1, the numerator tends to 1. So, in the limit:

In the example, the marginal propensity to consume is, on average, 0.6. This implies that the multiplier is equal to:

We can then apply the multiplier to the initial change in investment of 1.5 billion to find the sum of all the successive increases in production triggered by the initial hike in investment and aggregate demand: 2.51.5 billion =3.75 billion.
