2.10 Escaping from Malthusian stagnation
Nassau Senior, the economist who lamented that the numbers perishing in the Irish famine would scarcely be enough to do much good, does not appear compassionate. But he and Malthus were right to think that population growth and a diminishing average product of labour could create a vicious circle of economic stagnation and poverty. However, the hockey-stick graphs of living standards show they were wrong to believe that this could never change.
They did not consider the possibility that improvements in technology could happen at a faster rate than population growth, offsetting the diminishing average product of labour.
The permanent technological revolution, it turns out, means that the Malthusian model is no longer a reasonable description of the world. Average living standards increased rapidly and permanently after the capitalist revolution.
Figure 2.20 shows the real wage and population data from the 1280s to the 1860s. As we saw in Figure 2.18, from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century there was a clear negative relationship between population and real wages: when one went up the other went down, just as Malthusian theory suggests.
Between the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century, although wages rose there was relatively little population growth. Around 1740, we can see the Malthusian relationship again, labelled 18th century. Then, around 1800, the economy moved to what appears to be an entirely new regime, with both population and real wages simultaneously increasing. This is labelled Escape.

Escaping the Malthusian trap


In the eighteenth century, the Malthusian relationship persisted. In the nineteenth century, the economy appears to become a non-Malthusian regime, with real wages rising while population was increasing.

The permanent technological revolution


The story begins with technological improvements, such as the spinning jenny and the steam engine, that increased output per worker. Innovation continued as the technological revolution became permanent, displacing thousands of spinsters, weavers and farmers.

Urban unemployment


The loss of employment reduced workers bargaining power, keeping wages low, seen in the flat line between 1750 and 1830. The size of the pie was increasing, but the workers slice was not.

New opportunities


In the 1830s, higher productivity and low wages led to a surge in profits. Profits, competition, and technology drove businesses to expand. The demand for labour went up. People left farming for jobs in the new factories.

Workers bargaining power


The supply of labour fell when business owners were stopped from employing children. The combination of higher labour demand and lower supply enhanced workers bargaining power.

The escape from Malthusianism


The power of working people increased as they gained the right to vote and formed trade unions. These workers were able to claim a constant or rising share of the increases in productivity generated by the permanent technological revolution.

The story of the permanent technological revolution demonstrates that there are two influences on wages.

How much is produced: we can think of this as the size of the pie to be divided between workers and the owners of other inputs (land or machines).
The share going to workers: This depends on their bargaining power, which in turn depends on how wages are determined (individually, or through bargaining with trade unions, for example) and the supply and demand for workers. If many workers are competing for the same job, wages are likely to be low.

After 1830, the pie continued growing, and the workers share grew along with it.
Britain had escaped from the Malthusian trap. This process would soon be repeated in other countries, as Figures 1.1a and 1.1b showed.

In our Economist in action video, Suresh Naidu, an economic historian, explains how population growth, technological development and political events interacted to produce the real wage hockey stick.



Question 2.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Look again at Figure 2.20, which plots real wages against population in England from the 1280s to the 1860s.
According to Malthus, with diminishing average product of labour in production and population growth in response to increases in real wages, an increase in productivity will result in a larger population but not higher real wages in the long run. Based on the information above, which of the following statements is correct?

Between the 1800s and the 1860s, population grows as real wages rise. This is entirely in line with Malthuss description of the economys growth.
There is a clear evidence of a persistent and continuous Malthusian trap between the 1280s and the 1800s.
The Malthusian traps seem to occur in a cycle of 60 years.
The Malthusian model does not take into account the possibility of a persistent positive technology shock that may offset the diminishing average product of labour.


It is true that Malthus assumes population growth in response to real wage increases. However, as population increases the average per capita output falls, resulting in a fall in real wages back to subsistence level. This is not evident in the graph post-1800s.
There are actually two periodsbetween the 1280s and the 1590s, and between the 1740s and the 1800swhen a Malthusian trap is evident. There is, however, the period in between when the negative relationship between the real wage and population seems to break down (no population growth despite the wage increase).
Though the second cycle of the Malthusian trap lasted about 60 years (between the 1740s and the 1800s), the first cycle seems to have lasted around 300 years.
If technological developments increase the average productivity of labour faster than population growth decreases it, then population growth and real wages can coexist. This is what is shown by the escape trajectory of the English economy after the eighteenth century.



Exercise 2.11 The basic institutions of capitalism
The escape from the Malthusian trap, in which technological progress outstripped the effects of population growth, took place following the emergence of capitalism. Consider the three basic institutions of capitalism in turn:

Why is private property important for technological progress to occur?
Explain how markets can provide both carrots and sticks to encourage innovation.
How can production in firms, rather than families, contribute to the growth of living standards?
