8.8 The model of perfect competition

Perfect competition
A hypothetical market in which:

The good or service being exchanged is homogeneous (it does not differ from one seller to another).
There are large numbers of potential buyers and sellers of the good, each acting independently of the others.
Buyers and sellers can readily know the prices at which other buyers and sellers are exchanging the good.


To apply the model of supply and demand, we have assumed throughout this unit that buyers and sellers are price-takers. In what kinds of markets would we expect to see price-taking on both sides? To generate competition between sellers, and force sellers to act as price-takers, we need:

Many undifferentiated sellers: As Marshall discussed, there must be many sellers, all selling identical goods. If their goods were differentiated, then each one would have some market power.
Sellers must act independently: If they act as a cartel, for example, they are not price-takersthey can jointly choose the price.
Many buyers all wanting to buy the good: Each of them will choose whichever seller has the lowest price.
Buyers know the sellers prices: If they do not, they cannot choose the lowest one.

Similarly, buyers must force each other to be price-takers:

There must be many buyers, competing with each other: Then sellers have no reason to sell to someone who would pay less than everyone else.


perfectly competitive equilibriumSuch an equilibrium occurs in a model in which all buyers and sellers are price-takers. In this equilibrium, all transactions take place at a single price. This is known as the law of one price. At that price, the amount supplied equals the amount demanded: the market clears. No buyer or seller can benefit by altering the price they are demanding or offering. They are both price-takers. All potential gains from trade are realized. See also: law of one price.

A market with all of these properties is described as perfectly competitive. We can predict that the equilibrium in such a market will be a competitive equilibriumso it will have the following characteristics:

law of one priceHolds when a good is traded at the same price across all buyers and sellers. If a good were sold at different prices in different places, a trader could buy it cheaply in one place and sell it at a higher price in another. See also: arbitrage.gains from exchangeThe benefits that each party gains from a transaction compared to how they would have fared without the exchange. Also known as: gains from trade. See also: economic rent.


All transactions take place at a single price: This is known as the law of one price.

All potential gains from trade are realized.

Lon Walras, a ninteenth-century French economist, built a mathematical model of an economy in which all buyers and sellers are price-takers, which has been influential in how many economists think about markets.

Great economists Lon Walras

Lon Walras (18341910) was a founder of the neoclassical school of economics. He was an indifferent student, and twice failed the entrance exam to the cole Polytechnique in Paris, one of the most prestigious universities in his native France. He studied engineering at the School of Mines instead. Eventually his father, an economist, convinced him to take up the challenge of making economics into a science.
The pure economic science to which he aspired was the study of relationships among things, not people, and he had notable success in eliminating human relationships from his modelling. The pure theory of economics, he wrote, resembles the physico-mathematical sciences in every respect.
His device for simplifying the economy so that it could be expressed mathematically was to represent interactions among economic agents as if they were relationships among inputs and outputs, and to focus entirely on the economy in equilibrium. In the process the entrepreneur, a key actor in wealth creation from the Industrial Revolution to today, simply disappeared from Walrasian economics:

Assuming equilibrium, we may even go so far as to abstract from entrepreneurs and simply consider the productive services as being, in a certain sense, exchanged directly for one another (Elements of Theoretical Economics, 1874)8

Walras represented basic economic relationships as equations, which he used to study the workings of an entire economy composed of many interlinked markets. Prior to Walras, most economists had considered these markets in isolation: they would have studied, for example, how the price of textiles is determined on the cloth market, or land rents on the land market.
A century before Walras, a group of French economists called the physiocrats had studied the circulation of goods throughout the economy, as if the flow of goods from one sector to another in the economy was comparable to the circulation of blood in the human body (one of the leading physiocrats was a medical doctor). But the physiocrats model was little more than a metaphor that drew attention to the interconnectedness of markets.
Walras used mathematics, rather than medical analogies, to create what is now called general equilibrium theory, a mathematical model of an entire economy in which all buyers and sellers act as price-takers and supply equals demand in all markets. Walras work was the basis of the proof, much later, of the invisible hand theorem, giving the conditions under which such an equilibrium is Pareto efficient. The invisible hand game in Unit 4 is an example of the conditions in which the pursuit of self-interest can benefit everyone.
Walras had defended the right to private property, but to help the working poor he also advocated the nationalization of land and the elimination of taxes on wages.
Seven years after his death, the general equilibrium model was to play an important role in the debate about the feasibility and desirability of centralized economic planning compared to a market economy. In 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia put the economics of socialism and central planning on the agenda of many economists, but surprisingly, it was the defenders of central planning, not the advocates of the market, who used Walras insights to make their points.
Friedrich Hayek, and other defenders of capitalism, criticized the Walrasian general equilibrium model. Their argument: by deliberately ignoring the fact that a capitalist economy is constantly changing, and therefore not taking into account the contribution of entrepreneurship and creativity in market competition, Walras had missed the true virtues of the market.

The model of perfect competition describes an idealized market structure in which we can be confident that the assumption of price-taking that underlies our model of supply and demand will hold. Markets for agricultural products such as wheat, rice, coffee, or tomatoes look rather like this, although goods are not truly identical, and it is unlikely that everyone is aware of all the prices at which trade takes place. But it is nevertheless clear that they have very little, if any, power to affect the price at which they trade.
In other casesfor example, markets where there are some differences in the quality of goodsthere may still be enough competition that we can assume price-taking, in order to obtain a simple model of how the market works. A simplified model can provide useful predictions when the assumptions underlying it are only approximately true. Judging whether or not it is appropriate to draw conclusions about the real world from a simplified model is an important skill of economic analysis.
For example, we know that markets are not perfectly competitive when products are differentiated. Consumers preferences differ, and we saw in Unit 7 that firms have an incentive to differentiate their product, if they can, rather than to supply a product similar or identical to others. Nevertheless, the model of supply and demand can be a useful approximation to help us to understand how some markets for non-identical products behave.
Figure 8.18 shows the market for an imaginary product called Choccos, for which there are close substitutes, as many similar products compete in the wider market for chocolate bars. Due to competition from other chocolate bars, the demand curve is almost flat. The range of feasible prices for Choccos is narrow, and the firm chooses a price and quantity where the marginal cost is close to the price. So this firm is in a similar situation to a firm in a perfectly competitive market. It is the equilibrium price in the larger market for chocolate bars that determines the feasible prices for Choccosthey have to be sold at a similar price to other chocolate bars.

The market for Choccos


The left hand panel shows the market for Choccos, produced by one firm. There are many close substitutes in the wider market for chocolate bars.














The demand curve for Choccos


Due to competition from similar chocolate bars, the demand curve for Choccos is almost flat. The range of feasible prices is narrow.














The price of Choccos


The firm chooses a price P* similar to its competitors, and a quantity where MC is close to P*. Whatever the price of its competitors, it would produce close to its marginal cost curve. So the firms MC curve is approximately its supply curve.














The market supply curve for chocolate bars


We can construct the market supply curve for chocolate bars in the right hand panel by adding the quantities from the marginal cost curves of all the chocolate bar producers.














The market demand curve for chocolate bars


If most consumers do not have strong preferences for one firms product, we can draw a market demand curve for chocolate bars.














The demand curve for Choccos


The equilibrium price in the chocolate bar market (right-hand panel) determines the narrow range of prices from which the Chocco firm can choose (left-hand panel)it will have to set a price quite close to that of other chocolate bars.




The narrow range of feasible prices for this firm is determined by the behaviour of its competitors. So the main influence on the price of Choccos is not the firm, but the market for chocolate bars as a whole. Since all the firms will be producing at similar prices, which will be close to their marginal costs, we lose little by ignoring the differences between them and assuming that each firms supply curve is its marginal cost curve, then finding the equilibrium in the wider market for chocolate bars.
We have already taken this approach when we analysed the Danish butter market. In practice, it is likely that some retailers who sell butter have some power to set prices. A local shop may be able to set a price that is higher than the price of butter elsewhere, knowing that some shoppers will find it convenient to buy rather than searching for a lower price. However, it is reasonable to assume that they dont have much wiggle room to set prices, and are strongly influenced by the prevailing market price. So price-taking is a good approximation for this marketgood enough, at least, that the supply and demand model can help us to understand the impact of a fat tax.

Exercise 8.8 Price-fixing
We have used chocolate bars as a hypothetical example of an approximately competitive market. But in recent years, producers of best-selling chocolate bars worldwide have been accused of colluding with each other to keep prices high. Use the information in this article to explain:

In what ways does the market for chocolate bars fail to satisfy the conditions for perfect competition?
Each brand of chocolate bar faces competition from many other similar brands. Why, despite this, do some producers have considerable market power?
In what market conditions do you think price-fixing is most likely to occur, and why?



Question 8.11 Choose the correct answer(s)
Look again at Figure 8.18, which shows the market for Choccos and for all chocolate bars. Based on the two diagrams, which of the following statements is correct?

The firm that makes Choccos chooses to produce at the bottom of the U-shaped isoprofit curve.
All chocolate bars will be sold at the same price P*.
The existence of many competitors means that the firm is a price-taker.
The market marginal cost (MC) curve is approximately the sum of the MC curves of all the producers of the chocolate bars.


The firm chooses to produce where the isoprofit curve is tangent to the firms demand curve. As the demand curve is not quite horizontal, this point will be close to, but not at, the bottom of the U-shape.
The chocolate bars are not perfect substitutes. They will be sold at similar but not exactly the same prices.
The left-hand diagram shows that the firm has a downward-sloping demand curve, so it can choose from a narrow range of prices.
Each firm produces close to its MC curve, so the MC curve is approximately the firms supply curve, and so market supply is approximately the sum of the firms MC curves.
