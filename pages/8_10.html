8.9 Looking for competitive equilibria
If we look at a market in which conditions seem to favour perfect competitionmany buyers and sellers of identical goods, acting independentlyhow can we tell whether it satisfies the conditions for a competitive equilibrium? Economists have used two tests:

Do all trades take place at the same price?
Are firms selling goods at a price equal to marginal cost?

The difficulty with the second test is that it is often difficult to measure marginal cost. But Lawrence Ausubel, an economist, was able to do this for the US bank credit card market in the 1980s. At this time 4,000 banks were selling an identical product: credit card loans. The cards were mostly Visa or Mastercard, but the individual banks decided the price of their loansthat is, the interest rate. The banks cost of fundsthe opportunity cost of the money loaned to credit card holderscould be deduced from other interest rates in financial markets. Although there were other components of marginal cost, the cost of funds was the only one that varied substantially over time. So if the credit card market were competitive, we would expect to see the interest rate on credit card loans rise and fall with the cost of funds.
By comparing the credit card interest rate with the cost of funds over a period of eight years, Ausubel found that this didnt happen. When the cost of funds fell from 15% to below 7%, there seemed to be almost no effect on the price of credit card loans.9
Why do the banks not cut their interest rates when their costs fall? He suggested two different possibilities:

It may be difficult for consumers to change credit card provider: In that case, the banks are not forced to compete with each other, so they keep prices high when costs fall.
Banks might not be able to decide which of their customers are bad risks: That would be a problem in this market, because the bad risks are most sensitive to prices. The banks do not want to lower their prices for fear of attracting the wrong kind of customer.

Perfect competition requires that consumers are sufficiently sensitive to prices to force firms to compete, and this may not be the case in any market where consumers have to search for products. If it takes time and effort to check prices and inspect products, they may decide to buy as soon as they find something suitable, rather than continue the search for the cheapest. When the Internet made online shopping feasible, many economists hypothesized that this would make retail markets more competitive: consumers would easily be able to check the prices of many suppliers before deciding to buy.
But often consumers are not very sensitive to prices, even in this environment.10 You can test the law of one price in online retail competition for yourself, by checking the prices of a particular product that should be the same wherever you buy ita book or household appliance, for exampleand comparing them. Figure 8.19 shows the prices of UK online retailers for a particular DVD in March 2014. The range of prices is high: the most expensive seller is charging 66% more than the cheapest.

From the early nineteenth century, the catches of Atlantic fisherman landed in the port of New York were sold at the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan (in 2005, it relocated to the Bronx) to restaurants and retailers. It is still the largest market for fresh fish in the US, although fish are now brought in by road or air. Dealers do not display prices. Instead, customers can inspect the fish and ask for a price before making their decision, making it an institution that appears to encourage competition.
Kathryn Graddy, an economist who specializes in how prices are set, studied the Fulton Fish Market. There were about 35 dealers, with stalls close to each other, so customers could easily observe the quantity and quality of fish available and ask several dealers for a price. She used details of 3,357 sales of whiting by one dealer, including price, quantity, and quality of fish, and characteristics of the buyers.1112
Of course, prices were not the same for every transaction: quality varied, and fish supplies changed from day to day. But her surprising observation was that on average Asian buyers paid about 7% less per pound than white buyers (all of the dealers were white). There seemed to be no differences between the transactions with white and Asian buyers that could explain the different prices.
How could this happen? If one dealer was setting high prices for white buyers, why did other dealers not try to attract them to their own stalls by offering a better deal? Watch our interview with Graddy to find out how she collected her data, and what she discovered about the model of perfect competition.
In theory, the easy access to price information across the market should have allowed all buyers to quickly find very similar prices. But in practice, Graddy observed that bargaining occurred rarely, and then only with buyers of large quantities.
Graddy observed that dealers knew that, in practice, white buyers were willing to take higher prices than Asian buyers. The dealers knew this without having to collude in setting their prices.
The examples in this section show that it is hard to find evidence of perfect competition. Nevertheless, we have seen that the model can be a useful approximation. Even if the conditions for perfect competition are not all satisfied, the model of supply and demand is a valuable tool for economic analysis, applicable when there is enough competition that individuals have little influence on prices.

Kathryn Graddy: Fishing for perfect competition



Exercise 8.9 Price dispersion
Choose any published textbook that you have been using in your course. Go on to the web and find the price you can buy this book for from a number of different suppliers (Amazon, eBay, your local bookstore, and so on).
Is there dispersion in prices, and if so, how can you explain it?


Exercise 8.10 The Fulton Fish Market
Watch Kathryn Graddys video.

How does she explain her evidence that the law of one price did not hold in the fish market?
Why did buyers and sellers not look for better deals?
Why did new dealers not enter the market in pursuit of economic rents?
