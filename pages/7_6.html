7.5 Setting price and quantity to maximize profit
In Figure 7.11 we have shown both the demand curve and the isoprofit curves for Beautiful Cars. What is the best choice of price and quantity for the manufacturer?
The only feasible choices are the points on or below the demand curve, shown by the shaded area on the diagram. To maximize profit the firm should choose the tangency point E, which is on the highest possible isoprofit curve.

The profit-maximizing choice of price and quantity for Beautiful Cars.
        




The profit-maximizing price and quantity are P* = $5,440 and Q* = 32, and the corresponding profit is $63,360. As in the case of Cheerios, the optimal combination of price and quantity balances the trade-off that the firm would be willing to make between price and quantity (for a given profit level), against the trade-off the firm is constrained to make by the demand curve.
The firm maximizes profit at the tangency point, where the slope of the demand curve is equal to the slope of the isoprofit curve, so that the two trade-offs are in balance:

The demand curve is the feasible frontier, and its slope is the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) of lower prices into greater quantity sold.
The isoprofit curve is the indifference curve, and its slope is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) in profit creation, between selling more and charging more.

At E, the profit-maximizing point, MRT = MRS.
Leibniz: The profit-maximizing price
Compared with the multinational giants of the automobile industry, Beautiful Cars is a small firm: it chooses to make only 32 cars per day. In terms of its production levels (but not its prices) it is more similar to luxury brands like Aston-Martin, Rolls Royce and Lamborghini, each of which produces fewer than 5,000 cars a year. The size of Beautiful Cars is determined partly by its demand functionthere are only 100 potential buyers per day, at any price. In the longer term, the firm may be able to increase demand by advertising: bringing its product to the attention of more consumers, and convincing them of its desirable qualities. But if it wants to expand production it will also need to look at its cost structure, as in Figure 7.7. At present it has rapidly increasing marginal costs, so that average cost starts to rise when output per day exceeds 40. With its current premises and equipment it is difficult to produce more than 40 cars. Investment in new equipment may help to reduce its marginal cost, and might make expansion possible.
Constrained optimization

constrained choice problemThis problem is about how we can do the best for ourselves, given our preferences and constraints, and when the things we value are scarce. See also: constrained optimization problem.

The profit-maximization problem is another constrained choice problem, like those in earlier units: Alexeis choice of study time, your own and Angelas choices of working hours, and the choice of the wage by Marias employer.
Each of these problems has the same structure:

The decision-maker wants to choose the values of one or more variables to achieve a goal, or objective. For Beautiful Cars, the variables are price and quantity.
The objective is to optimize something: to maximize utility, minimize costs, or maximize profit.
The decision-maker faces a constraint, which limits what is feasible: Angelas production function, your budget constraint, Marias best response curve, the demand curve for Beautiful Cars.

In each case, we have represented the decision-makers choice graphically, by showing the indifference curves, which relate to the objective (iso-utility, isocost, or isoprofit), and the feasible set of outcomes, which is determined by the constraint. And we have found the solution of the problem at the tangency point where the MRS (slope of the indifference curve) is equal to the MRT (slope of the constraint).

Constrained optimization has many applications in economics; such problems can be solved mathematically, as well as graphically.

Question 7.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 7.11 depicts the demand curve for Beautiful Cars, together with the marginal cost and isoprofit curves. The quantity-price combination at point E is (Q*, P*) = (32, 5,440). The average cost of producing 50 cars is the same as the average cost of producing 32. Suppose that the firm keeps the price at P = $5,440 but now produces 50 cars instead of 32. Which of the following is correct?

The firm will now sell all 50 cars at $5,440.
The firms profit will increase.
The firms profit remains the same.
The firms profit is now reduced.


From the demand curve we can see that at $5,440, the firm can only sell 32 cars.
The firms profit is reduced by the cost of producing the extra 18 cars that now remain unsold.
The firms profit is reduced by the cost of producing the extra 18 cars that now remain unsold.
The firms profit is reduced by the cost of producing the extra 18 cars that now remain unsold.



Question 7.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 7.11 depicts the demand curve for Beautiful Cars, together with the marginal cost and isoprofit curves. At point E, the quantity-price combination is (Q*, P*) = (32, 5,440) and the profit is $63,360.
Suppose that the firm chooses instead to produce Q = 32 cars and sets the price at P = $5,400. Which of the following statements is correct?

The profit remains the same at $63,360.
The profit is reduced to $62,080.
The average cost of production is $3,400.
The firm is unable to sell all the cars.


Since Q is still 32, production costs remain the same, but revenue falls, so profit falls.
Since Q is still 32, production costs remain the same. Revenue falls by $40 on each car, so by $1,280 in total. So profit is $63,360  $1,280 = $62,080.
At E, where Q* = 32 and P* = $5440, the profit is $63,360. So the profit per car is $63,360/32 = $1,980. Since $5,440  AC = $1,980, AC must be $3,460. AC is the same whatever the price charged.
At the lower price the market demand is higher than 32, so the firm will have no problem selling all 32 cars at the new price.



Question 7.11 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 7.11 depicts the demand curve for Beautiful Cars, together with the marginal cost and isoprofit curves.
Suppose that the firm decides to switch from P* = $5,440 and Q* = 32 to a higher price, and chooses the profit-maximizing level of output at the new price. Which of the following statements is correct?

The quantity of cars produced is reduced.
The marginal cost of producing an extra car is higher.
The total cost of production is higher.
The profit is increased due to the new higher price.


At a higher price than P*, the maximum number of cars that can be sold is less than 32, and the firm will not produce more cars than it can sell.
The firm will produce fewer than 32 cars. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping, so at a lower output the marginal cost is lower.
The firm will produce fewer than 32 cars, so its total costs will be lower.
Any feasible point other than E is on a lower isoprofit curve.
