9.13 Conclusion
The model of the labour market is quite different from the model of equilibrium of price-taking buyers and sellers in Unit 8. The most obvious difference is that the labour market does not clear, even in equilibrium.
Involuntary unemployment at labour market equilibrium is unavoidable, because:

Employers and workers have a conflict of interest: This is over how hard employees work.
Employers cannot write a complete contract with their employees: They cannot specify the quality and quantity of work effort they will receive.

The extent of equilibrium unemployment is affected by how governments regulate labour and other markets. In Units 16 and 17 we shall see how these policies and the behaviour of labour unions and employers have affected the unemployment experience of different countries over the past few decades.
Unemployment can be higher than equilibrium unemployment as a result of a fall in the economy-wide demand for goods and services. In the example of the Greys in Australia, this was due to global movements in demand for commodities. But there are many other causes of fluctuations in aggregate demand that will be explored in the coming units.
Where unemployment is raised above the equilibrium level because of a lack of aggregate demand, governments and central banks can use fiscal and monetary policies to reduce it. This is likely to work better than relying on firms to cut wages and prices, and on households and firms to respond to those falling wages and prices by increasing their purchases.

principalagent relationshipThis relationship exists when one party (the principal) would like another party (the agent) to act in some way, or have some attribute that is in the interest of the principal, and that cannot be enforced or guaranteed in a binding contract. See also: incomplete contract. Also known as: principalagent problem.

The principalagent model of the employer and the employee that we have used in this unit will appear in a new setting in the next unit: the credit market. Whereas in the labour market the principal is the employer and the agent the worker, in the credit market the principal is the lender and the agent the borrower. We saw here that in the labour market equilibrium there will be some people involuntarily unemployed, seeking a job and willing to work at the going wage rate. So, also, we will see that in the credit market there will be people seeking loans and willing to pay the going rate of interest, but unable to get a loan.
