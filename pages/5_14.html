5.13 A policy to redistribute the surplus and raise efficiency
Angela and Bruno live in the hypothetical world of an economic model. But real farmers and landowners face similar problems.
In the Indian state of West Bengal, home to more people than Germany, many farmers work as sharecroppers (bargadars in the Bengali language), renting land from landowners in exchange for a share of the crop.
The traditional contractual arrangements throughout this vast state varied little from village to village, with virtually all bargadars giving half their crop to the landowner at harvest time. This had been the norm since at least the eighteenth century.
But, like Angela, in the second half of the twentieth century many thought this was unfair, because of the extreme levels of deprivation among the bargadars. In 1973, 73% of the rural population lived in poverty, one of the highest poverty rates in India. In 1978, the newly elected Left Front government of West Bengal adopted new laws, called Operation Barga.
The new laws stated that:

Bargadars could keep up to three-quarters of their crop.
Bargadars were protected from eviction by landowners, provided they paid them the 25% quota.

Both provisions of Operation Barga were advocated as a way of increasing output. There are certainly reasons to predict that the size of the pie would increase, as well as the incomes of the farmers:

Bargadars had a greater incentive to work hard and well: Keeping a larger share meant that there was a greater reward if they grew more crops.
Bargadars had an incentive to invest in improving the land: They were confident that they would farm the same plot of land in the future, so would be rewarded for their investment.

West Bengal enjoyed a subsequent dramatic increase in farm output per unit of land, as well as farming incomes. By comparing the output of farms before and after the implementation of Operation Barga, economists concluded that both improved work motivation and investment occurred. One study suggested that Operation Barga was responsible for around 28% of the subsequent growth in agricultural productivity in the region. The empowerment of the bargadars also had positive spillover effects as local governments became more responsive to the needs of poor farmers.5
Efficiency and fairness
Operation Barga was later cited by the World Bank as an example of good policy for economic development.6
Figure 5.17 summarizes the concepts developed in this unit that we can use to judge the impact of an economic policy. Having gathered evidence to describe the resulting allocation, we ask: is it Pareto efficient, and fair? Is it better than the original allocation by these criteria?











Efficiency and fairness.

The evidence that Operation Barga increased incomes indicates that the pie got larger, and the poorest people got a larger slice.
In principle, the increase in the size of the pie means there could be mutual gains from the reforms, with both farmers and landowners made better off.
However, the actual change in the allocation was not a Pareto improvement. The incomes of some landowners fell following the reduction in their share of the crop. Nevertheless, in increasing the income of the poorest people in West Bengal, we might judge that Operation Barga was fair. We can assume that many people in West Bengal thought so, because they continued to vote for the Left Front alliance. It stayed in power from 1977 until 2011.
We do not have detailed information for Operation Barga, but we can illustrate the effect of the land reform on the distribution of income in the hypothetical village of the previous section, with 90 sharecroppers and 10 landowners. Figure 5.18 shows the Lorenz curves. Initially, the farmers pay a rent of 50% of their crop to the landowners. Operation Barga raises the farmers crop share to 75%, moving the Lorenz curve towards the 45-degree line. As a result, the Gini coefficient of income is reduced from 0.4 (similar to the US) to 0.15 (well below that of the most equal of the rich economies, such as Denmark). The Einstein at the end of this section shows you how the Gini coefficient depends on the proportion of farmers and their crop share.

Einstein The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient in a class-divided economy with a large population
Think about a population of 100 people in which a fraction n produce the output, and the others are employers (or landlords, or other claimants on income who are not producers).
Take, as an example, the farmers and landlords in the text (in West Bengal). Each of the n  100 farmers produces q and he or she receives a fraction, s, of this; so each of the farmers has income sq. The (1  n)  100  employers each receive an income of (1  s)q.
The figure below presents the Lorenz curve and the perfect equality line similar to Figure 5.18 in the text.











Figure 5.19 
The Lorenz curve and the perfect equality line.
        




The slope of the line separating area A from B1 is s/n (the fraction of total output that each farmer gets), and the slope of the line separating area A from B3 is (1  s)/(1  n), the fraction of total output that each landlord gets. We can approximate the Gini coefficient by the expression A/(A + B), where in the figure B = B1 + B2 + B3.
So we can express the Gini coefficient in terms of the triangles and rectangle in the figure. To see how, note that the area of the entire square is 1 while the area (A+B) under the perfect equality line is 1/2. The area A is (1/2)  B. Then we can write the Gini coefficient as

We can see from the figure that

so,

This means that the Gini coefficient in this simple case is just the fraction of the total population producing the output (the farmers) minus the fraction of the output that they receive in income.
Inequality will increase in this model economy if:

The fraction of producers in the economy increases but the total share of output they receive remains unchanged. This would be the case if some of the landlords became farmer tenants, each receiving a fraction s of the crop they produced.
The fraction of the crop received by the producers falls.
