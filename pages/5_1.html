How institutions influence the balance of power in economic interactions, and affect the fairness and efficiency of the allocations that result

Technology, biology, economic institutions, and peoples preferences are all important determinants of economic outcomes.
Power is the ability to do and get the things we want in opposition to the intentions of others.
Interactions between economic actors can result in mutual gains, but also in conflicts over how the gains are distributed.
Institutions influence the power and other bargaining advantages of actors.
The criteria of efficiency and fairness can help evaluate economic institutions and the outcomes of economic interactions.

Perhaps one of your distant ancestors considered that the best way to get money was by shipping out with a pirate like Blackbeard or Captain Kidd. If he had settled on Captain Bartholomew Roberts pirate ship the Royal Rover, he and the other members of the crew would have been required to consent to the ships written constitution. This document (called The Royal Rovers Articles) guaranteed, among other things, that:1

Article I
Every Man has a Vote in the Affairs on the Moment; has equal title to fresh Provisions
Article III
No person to Game at Cards or Dice for Money.
Article IV
The Lights and Candles to be put out at eight a-Clock at Night; If any of the Crew after that Hour still remained enclined for drinking, they are to do so on the open Deck
Article X
The Captain and Quarter Master to receive two Shares of a Prize (the booty from a captured ship); the Master, Boatswain, and Gunner one Share and a half, and other Officers one and a Quarter (everyone else to receive one share, called his Dividend.)
Article XI
The Musicians to have Rest on the Sabbath Day but the other six Days and Nights none without special Favour.

The Royal Rover and its Articles were not unusual. During the heyday of European piracy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, most pirate ships had written constitutions that guaranteed even more powers to the crew members. Their captains were democratically elected (the Rank of Captain being obtained by the Suffrage of the Majority). Many captains were also voted out, at least one for cowardice in battle. Crews also elected one of their number as the quartermaster who, when the ship was not in a battle, could countermand the captains orders.
If your ancestor had served as a lookout and had been the first to spot a ship that was later taken as a prize, he would have received as a reward the best Pair of Pistols on board, over and above his Dividend. Were he to have been seriously wounded in battle, the articles guaranteed him compensation for the injury (more for the loss of a right arm or leg than for the left). He would have worked as part of a multiracial, multi-ethnic crew of which probably about a quarter were of African origin, and the rest primarily of European descent, including Americans.
The result was that a pirate crew was often a close-knit group. A contemporary observer lamented that the pirates were wickedly united, and articled together. Sailors of captured merchant ships often happily joined the roguish Commonwealth of their pirate captors.
Another unhappy commentator remarked: These Men whom we term the Scandal of human Nature, who were abandoned to all Vice were strictly just among themselves. If they were Responders in the ultimatum game (explained in Unit 4, Section 4.10), by this description they would have rejected any offer less than half of the pie!
