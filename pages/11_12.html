11.11 The role of economic rents
An economic rent is a payment or other benefit that someone receives that is superior to his or her next best alternative. Throughout this unit, we have seen how economic rents play a role in the changes that take place in the economy.

In the real case of the Kerala fisherman, and the hypothetical market for hats, rent-seeking by buyers or sellers in response to a situation of excess supply or demand brought about a market-clearing equilibrium.
In the model of the bread market, rents (economic profits) can arise in a short-run equilibrium in which the number of firms is fixed. In the long run, other bakeries enter the market in pursuit of these rents.
In the world oil market, rents for oil producers arise from the constraints on producers and consumers that make supply and demand curves inelastic in the short-run, but in turn provide incentives for building new wells for exploration.
In asset markets, rents arise when the price deviates from the fundamental value of the asset, providing opportunities for speculation and creating the potential for bubbles.
In markets that do not clear because prices are controlled, excess demand gives rise to a potential economic rent, which leads (unless prevented by regulation) to the development of a clearing secondary market.
Another example, from Unit 2, is the innovation rent obtained by early innovators, which provides the incentive to adopt a new technology.


disequilibrium rentThe economic rent that arises when a market is not in equilibrium, for example when there is excess demand or excess supply in a market for some good or service. In contrast, rents that arise in equilibrium are called equilibrium rents.equilibrium rentRent in a market that is in equilibrium. Also known as: stationary or persistent rents.

In each of these examples, rents arise because of some kind of disequilibrium, or short-run constraintwe call them dynamic or disequilibrium rents. They set in motion a processrent-seekingthat ultimately creates an equilibrium in which these kinds of rents no longer exist. In contrast, we have also seen examples of persistent or stationary rents. The main examples are shown in the table in Figure 11.23.

In the models studied in this unit, we have seen that if markets do not clear, there are disequilibrium rents that give incentives for people to change the prices or quantities at which they transact, and so bring about market clearing. The labour market (see Unit 9) is different: it does not clear in equilibrium. Employees therefore receive a rentthe difference between the wage and their reservation option. But in this case it is a persistent or equilibrium rent: because a contract to work hard is unenforceable there is no way any buyer (the employer) or seller (the worker) can benefit by changing his or her price or quantity.
Economic rents and rent-seekers often have a bad name in economics. People disapprove because they think about rents as those arising from government-created monopolies (taxi licenses, intellectual property rights) or privately created monopolies. These rents indicate that the good or service will be sold at a price exceeding its marginal cost, and so the markets for these goods are not Pareto efficient.
But we have now seen the usefulness of some economic rents. They encourage innovation, provide incentives for employees to work hard, encourage new entrants to a market and thereby lower prices for consumers, and can bring an out-of-equilibrium market to a Pareto-efficient equilibrium.

Question 11.11 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following are stationary rents?

Innovation rent where firms make positive economic profits from a new invention.
Employment rent where the wage is set high to induce workers to work hard.
Monopoly rent where firms make excess profits due to limited competition.
Speculative rent where profits are made by correctly betting on the price changes in a bubble.


Innovation rent is only temporary until other firms catch upit is a dynamic rent.
Employers will continue to pay wages above the reservation wage, because otherwise employees would reduce their work effort.
When competition is limited, firms will continue to produce where price is greater than marginal cost.
This is clearly not permanent!
