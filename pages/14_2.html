14.1 The transmission of shocks: The multiplier process
In a capitalist economy, private investment spending is driven by expectations about future post-tax profits. As we saw in Unit 13, spending on investment projects tends to occur in clusters. Two reasons for this observation are:

Firms may adopt a new technology at the same time.
Firms may have similar beliefs about expected future demand.

We need a tool to help us understand how decisions of firms (and households) to raise or reduce investment spending will affect the economy as a whole. You will recall that some households are able to completely smooth temporary bumps in their income, but that in credit-constrained households, higher income from getting a job or moving from part-time to full-time work will also lead to higher consumption spending.

aggregate demandThe total of the components of spending in the economy, added to get GDP: Y = C + I + G + X  M. It is the total amount of demand for (or expenditure on) goods and services produced in the economy. See also: consumption, investment, government spending, exports, imports.

As a result, changes in current income influence spending, affecting the income of others, so indirect effects through the economy amplify the direct effect of a shock to aggregate demand (often shortened to AD) created by an investment boom.
We will show how economists answer such questions as how large would the total direct and indirect impact of a rise in investment spending be? or, what would be the effect of lower government spending?
A statistic called the multiplier provides one way of answering this question. Imagine there is a new technology. New spending takes place in the economy as a result; output of the new capital goods rises, as do the incomes of the people producing them. The circular flow of expenditure, income, and output previously shown in Figure 13.6 illustrates this process.

If the total increase in GDP is equal to the initial increase in spending: We say that the multiplier is equal to 1.
If the total increase in GDP is greater or less than the initial increase in spending: We say that the multiplier is greater than 1 or less than 1.


multiplier processA mechanism through which the direct and indirect effect of a change in autonomous spending affects aggregate output. See also: fiscal multiplier, multiplier model.consumption function (aggregate)An equation that shows how consumption spending in the economy as a whole depends on other variables. For example, in the multiplier model, the other variables are current disposable income and autonomous consumption. See also: disposable income, autonomous consumption.

To see why GDP may rise by more than the initial increase in investment spending, we explain what economists call the multiplier process. We do this by combining the very different behaviour of consumption-smoothing and non-smoothing households to represent consumption spending for the economy as a whole. In this aggregate consumption function, consumption depends on current income, among other things. Recall that in the model of Unit 13, consumption-smoothing households will not increase their consumption one-for-one, or even at all, in response to a temporary 1 increase in their income. Credit-constrained and other households who do not smooth, on the other hand, will increase their current consumption by 1 in response to a temporary 1 increase in their income.
In 2008, when governments considered temporary increases in government spending and tax cuts in response to the recession that followed the global financial crisis, the size of the multiplier became the subject of a debate among policymakers and economists. We return to this debate later in the unit.
As we shall see, the multiplier is greater than 1 if the additional consumption spending resulting from a temporary 1 increase in income is greater than zero but less than 1 (say, for example, 60 cents).
After explaining how this is a consequence of the multiplier process, we will show that the validity of the assumptions we make in the multiplier model depend on the state of the economy.
