7.6 Looking at profit maximization as marginal revenue and marginal cost
In the previous section we showed that the profit-maximizing choice for Beautiful Cars was the point at which the demand curve was tangent to the highest isoprofit curve. To make maximum profit, it should produce Q = 32 cars and sell them at a price P = $5,440.

marginal revenueThe increase in revenue obtained by increasing the quantity from Q to Q + 1.

We now look at a different method of finding the profit-maximizing point, without using isoprofit curves. Instead, we use the marginal revenue curve. Remember that if Q cars are sold at a price P, revenue R is given by R = P  Q. The marginal revenue, MR, is the increase in revenue obtained by increasing the quantity from Q to Q + 1.
Figure 7.12a shows you how to calculate the marginal revenue when Q = 20: that is, the increase in revenue if quantity increases by one unit.

Revenue when Q = 21


If quantity is increased to 21, the price falls to $6,320. The change in price is P=$80. The revenue at Q = 21 is shown by the area of the new rectangle, which is $6,320  21.

Marginal revenue when Q = 20


The marginal revenue at Q = 20 is the difference between the two areas. The table shows that the area of the rectangle is larger when Q = 21. The marginal revenue is $4,720.

Why is MR > 0?


The increase in revenue happens because the firm gains $6,320 on the 21st car, and this gain is greater than the loss of 20  $80 from selling the other 20 cars at a lower price.

Calculating the marginal revenue


The table shows that the marginal revenue can also be calculated as the difference between the gain of $6,320 and the loss of $1,600.




Figure 7.12a shows that the firms revenue is the area of the rectangle drawn below the demand curve. When Q is increased from 20 to 21, revenue changes for two reasons. An extra car is sold at the new price, but since the new price is lower when Q = 21, there is also a loss of $80 on each of the other 20 cars. The marginal revenue is the net effect of these two changes.
In Figure 7.12b we find the marginal revenue curve, and use it to find the point of maximum profit. The upper panel shows the demand curve, and the middle panel shows the marginal cost curve. The analysis in Figure 7.12b shows how to calculate and plot the marginal revenue curve. When P is high and Q is low, MR is high: the gain from selling one more car is much greater than the total loss on the small number of other cars. As we move down the demand curve P falls (so the gain on the last car gets smaller), and Q rises (so the total loss on the other cars is bigger), so MR falls and eventually becomes negative.

Demand and marginal cost curves


The upper panel shows the demand curve, and the middle panel shows the marginal cost curve. At point A, Q = 10, P = $7,200, revenue is $72,000.














Marginal revenue


The marginal revenue (middle panel) at A is the difference between the areas of the two rectangles: MR = $6,320.














Marginal revenue when Q = 20


Marginal revenue when Q = 20 and P=$6,400 is $4,880.














Moving down the demand curve


As we move down the demand curve, P falls and MR falls by more. The gain on the extra car gets smaller, and the loss on the other cars is bigger.














MR < 0


At point D, the gain on the extra car is outweighed by the loss on the others, so the marginal revenue is negative.














The marginal revenue curve


Joining the points in the middle panel gives the marginal revenue curve.














MR > MC


MR and MC cross at point E, where Q=32. MR > MC at any value of Q below 32: the revenue from selling an extra car is greater than the cost of making it, so it would be better to increase production.














MR < MC


When Q > 32, MR < MC: if the firm was producing more than 32 cars it would lose profit if it made an extra car, and it would increase profit if it made fewer cars.














The firms profit


In the lower panel we have plotted the firms profit at each point on the demand curve. You can see that when Q < 32, MR > MC, and profit increases if Q increases. When Q = 32, profit is maximized. When Q > 32, MR < MC, and profit falls if Q rises.




The marginal revenue curve is usually (although not necessarily) a downward-sloping line. The lower two panels in Figure 7.12b demonstrate that the profit-maximizing point is where the MR curve crosses the MC curve. To understand why, remember that profit is the difference between revenue and costs, so for any value of Q, the change in profit if Q was increased by one unit (the marginal profit) would be the difference between the change in revenue, and the change in costs:

So:

If MR > MC, the firm could increase profit by raising Q.
If MR < MC, the marginal profit is negative. It would be better to decrease Q.

Leibniz: Marginal revenue and marginal cost
You can see how profit changes with Q in the lowest panel of 7.12b. Just as marginal cost is the slope of the cost function, marginal profit is the slope of the profit function. In this case:

When Q < 32, MR > MC: Marginal profit is positive, so profit increases with Q.
When Q > 32, MR < MC: Marginal profit is negative; profit decreases with Q.
When Q = 32, MR = MC: Profit reaches a maximum.


Question 7.12 Choose the correct answer(s)
This figure shows the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves for Beautiful Cars. Which of the following statements is correct, based on the information shown?













When Q = 40, the marginal cost is greater than the marginal revenue so the firms profit must be negative.
Revenue is greater when Q = 10 than if Q = 20.
The firm would not choose to produce at point E because marginal profit is zero.
Profit is greater when Q = 20 than when Q = 10.


When Q = 40 the marginal cost is greater than the marginal revenue so the marginal profit is negative. This doesnt mean that profit is negative.
The marginal revenue is greater at Q = 10 than Q = 20. But because the marginal revenue is positive as output increases from 10 to 20, revenue is increasing: it is higher at Q = 20.
Marginal profit is zero at E. But this is the profit-maximizing point, so the firm will choose it.
At all levels of output up to point E, marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. So profit increases as output increasesit is higher at Q = 20 than Q = 10.
