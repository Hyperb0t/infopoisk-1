5.10 Bargaining to a Pareto-efficient sharing of the surplus
Angela and her friends are pleased with their success. She asks what you think of the new policy.

Pareto efficiency curveThe set of all allocations that are Pareto efficient. Often referred to as the contract curve, even in social interactions in which there is no contract, which is why we avoid the term. See also: Pareto efficient.


You
Congratulations, but your policy is far from the best you could do.
Angela
Why?
You
Because you are not on the Pareto efficiency curve! Under your new law, Bruno is getting 2 bushels, and cannot make you work more than 4 hours. So why dont you offer to continue to pay him 2bushels, in exchange for agreeing to let you keep anything you produce above that? Then you get to choose how many hours you work.

The small print in the law allows a longer work day if both parties agree, as long as the workers reservation option is a 4-hour day if no agreement is reached.

You
Now redraw Figure 5.9 and use the concepts of the joint surplus and the Pareto efficiency curve from Figure 5.8 to show Angela how she can get a better deal.
You
Look at Figure 5.10. The surplus is largest at 8 hours of work. When you work for 4 hours the surplus is smaller, and you pay most of it to Bruno. If you increase the surplus, you can pay him the same amount, and your own surplus will be biggerso you will be better off. Follow the steps in Figure 5.10 to see how this works.

The maximum joint surplus


The surplus to be divided between Angela and Bruno is maximized where MRT = MRS, at 8 hours of work.














Angela prefers F to D


But Angela prefers point F implemented by the legislation, because it gives her the same amount of grain but more free time than D.














Angela could also do better than F


Compared to F, she would prefer any allocation on the Pareto efficiency curve between C and G.














Angela can propose H


At allocation H, Bruno gets the same amount of grain: CH = EF. Angela is better off than she was at F. She works longer hours, but has more than enough grain to compensate her for the loss of free time.














A win-win agreement by moving to an allocation between G and H


F is not Pareto efficient because MRT > MRS. If they move to a point on the Pareto efficiency curve between G and H, Angela and Bruno can both be better off.




The move away from point D (at which Bruno had all the bargaining power and obtained all the gains from exchange) to point H where Angela is better off consists of two distinct steps:


From D to F, the outcome is imposed by new legislation. This was definitely not win-win: Bruno lost because his economic rent at F is less than the maximum feasible rent that he got at D. Angela benefitted.


Once at the legislated outcome, there were many win-win possibilities open to them. They are shown by the segment GH on the Pareto efficiency curve. Win-win alternatives to the allocation at F are possible by definition, because F was not Pareto efficient.


Bruno wants to negotiate. He is not happy with Angelas proposal of H.

Bruno
I am no better off under this new plan than I would be if I just accepted the legislation that the farmers passed.
You
But Bruno, Angela now has bargaining power, too. The legislation changed her reservation option, so it is no longer 24 hours of free time at survival rations. Her reservation option is now the legislated allocation at point F. I suggest you make her a counter offer.
Bruno
Angela, Ill let you work the land for as many hours as you choose if you pay me half a bushel more than EF.

They shake hands on the deal.
Because Angela is free to choose her work hours, subject only to paying Bruno the extra half bushel, she will work 8 hours where MRT = MRS. Because this deal lies between G and H, it is a Pareto improvement over point F. Moreover, because it is on the Pareto-efficient curve CD, we know there are no further Pareto improvements to be made. This is true of every other allocation on GHthey differ only in the distribution of the mutual gains, as some favour Angela while others favour Bruno. Where they end up will depend on their bargaining power.

Question 5.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Figure 5.10, Angela and Bruno are at allocation F, where she receives 4.5 bushels of grain for 4 hours of work.
From the figure, we can conclude that:

All the points on EF are Pareto efficient.
Any point in the area between G, H and F would be a Pareto improvement.
Any point between G and D would be a Pareto improvement.
They would both be indifferent between all points on GH.


Along EF, MRS < MRT. So EF is not Pareto efficientthere are other allocations where both would be better off.
In area GHF, Angela is on a higher indifference curve than IC2, and Bruno has more grain than EF, so both are better off.
Points on GD are Pareto efficient, but below G, Angela is on a lower indifference curve than at F, so she would be worse off.
Points on GH are all Pareto efficient, but Bruno and Angela are not indifferent. He prefers points nearer to G, and she prefers points nearer to H.
