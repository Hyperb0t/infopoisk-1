6.7 Wages, effort, and profits in the labour discipline model
Maria is not in the situation that Angela faced when Bruno could order her to work at the point of a gun. Maria has bargaining power because she can always walk awayan option that, initially, Angela did not have.
Maria chooses how hard she works. The best the owner can do is to determine the conditions under which she makes that choice. The owners and managers know that they cannot get Maria to provide more effort than is given by the best response curve shown in Figure 6.4. The fact that the best response curve slopes upwards means that employers face a trade-off. They can get more effort only by paying higher wages.
As we saw in Unit 2, to maximize profits, firms want to minimize the costs of production. In particular, they want to pay the lowest possible price for inputs. A company purchasing oil for use in the production process will look for the supplier that can provide it at the lowest price per litre, or equivalently, supply the most oil per dollar. Likewise, Maria provides an input to production, and her employer would like to purchase it at the lowest price. But this does not mean paying the lowest possible wage. We already know that if he paid the reservation wage, workers might show up (they wouldnt care one way or the other), but they would not work if they did.
The wage, w, is the cost to the employer of an hour of a workers time. But what matters for production is not how many hours Maria provides, but how many units of effort: effort is the input to the production process. If Maria chooses to provide 0.5 units of effort per hour, and her hourly wage is w, the cost to the employer of a unit of effort is 2w. In general, if she provides e units of effort per hour, the cost of a unit of effort is w/e.
So, to maximize profits, the employer should find a feasible combination of effort and wage that minimizes the cost per unit of effort, w/e.
Another way to say the same thing is that the employer should maximize the number of units of effort (sometimes called efficiency units) that he gets per dollar of wage cost, e/w.
The upward-sloping straight line in Figure 6.5 joins together a set of points that have the same ratio of effort to wages, e/w. If the wage is $10 per hour and a worker provides 0.45 units of effort per hour, the employer gets 0.045 efficiency units per dollar. Equivalently, a unit of effort costs $10/0.45 = $22.2. The employer would be indifferent between this situation and one in which the wage is $20 with an effort of 0.9the cost of effort is exactly the same at all points on the line. We will call this an isocost line for effort. Similarly to the isocost lines in Unit 2, these lines join points that have identical effects on the employers costs. We can also think of it as an indifference curve for the employer.

The employers indifference curves: Isocost curves for effort.
        















An isocost line for effort


If w = $10 and e = 0.45, e/w = 0.045. At every point on this line the ratio of effort to wages is the same. The cost of a unit of effort is w/e = $22.22.














The slope of the isocost line


The line slopes upward because a higher effort level must be accompanied by a higher wage for the e/w ratio to remain unchanged. The slope is equal to e/w = 0.045, the number of units of effort per dollar.














Other isocost lines


On an isocost line, the slope is e/w, but the cost of effort is w/e. The steeper line has a lower cost of effort, and the flatter line has a higher cost of effort.














Some lines are better for the employer than others


A steeper line means lower cost of effort and hence higher profits for the employer. On the steepest isocost line he gets 0.7 units of effort for a wage of $10 (at B) so the cost of effort is $10/0.7 = $14.29 per unit. On the middle line he only gets 0.45 units of effort at this wage, so the cost of effort is $22.22, and profits are lower.














The slope is the MRS


The employer is indifferent between points on an isocost line. Like other indifference curves, the slope of the effort isocost line is the marginal rate of substitution: the rate at which the employer is willing to increase wages to get higher effort.




To minimize costs, the employer will seek to reach the steepest isocost line for effort, where the cost of a unit of effort is lowest. But because he cannot dictate the level of effort, he has to pick some point on Marias best response curve.
The best he can do is to set the wage at $12 on the isocost line that is tangent to Marias best response curve (point A). Use the analysis in Figure 6.6 to see how the employer sets the wage.












Figure 6.6 
The employer sets the wage to minimize the cost of effort.
        















Minimizing the cost of effort


To maximize profits, the owner wants to obtain effort at the lowest cost. He will seek to get onto the steepest isocost line possible. But because he cannot dictate the level of effort, he has to pick some point on the workers best response curve.














C is not the best the employer can do


Could this be a point such as C? No. It is clear that by paying more the owner will benefit from a lower wage-effort ratio.














Point A is the best the employer can do


The best he can do is the isocost line that is just touching (tangent to) the workers best response curve.














MRS = MRT


At this point, the marginal rate of substitution (the slope of the isocost line for effort) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation of higher wages into greater effort (the slope of the best response function).














Point B


Points on steeper isocosts, such as Point B, would have lower costs for the employer but are infeasible.














Minimum feasible costs


Therefore $12 is the hourly wage that the employer should set to minimize costs and maximize profits.




In Figure 6.6, the employer will choose point A, offering a wage of $12 per hour to hire Maria, who will exert effort of 0.5. The employer cannot do better than this point: any point with lower costs, for example, point B, is infeasible.
The employer minimizes costs and maximizes profit at the point where his MRS (the slope of his indifference curve or isocost line) equals the MRT (the slope of the best response curve, which is his feasible frontier). He balances the trade-off he is willing to make between wages and effort against the trade-off he is constrained to make by Marias response.
Leibniz: Finding the profit-maximizing wage
This is a constrained choice problem, similar to the one in Unit 3. There, individuals maximizing utility chose working hours where MRS = MRT: the slope of their indifference curve equalled the slope of the feasible frontier determined by the production technology.

efficiency wagesThe payment an employer makes that is higher than an employees reservation wage, so as to motivate the employee to provide more effort on the job than he or she would otherwise choose to make. See also: labour discipline model, employment rent.

When wages are set by the employer in this manner, they are sometimes called efficiency wages because the employer is recognizing that what matters for profits is e/w, the efficiency units per dollar of wage costs, rather than how much an hour of work costs.

labour discipline modelA model that explains how employers set wages so that employees receive an economic rent (called employment rent), which provides workers an incentive to work hard in order to avoid job termination. See also: employment rent, efficiency wages.

What has the labour discipline model told us?

Equilibrium: In the owner-employee game, the employer offers a wage and Maria provides a level of effort in response. Their strategies are a Nash equilibrium.
Rent: In this allocation Maria provides effort because she receives an employment rent that she might lose if she were to slack off on the job.
Power: Because Maria fears losing this economic rent, the employer is able to exercise power over her, getting her to act in ways that she would not do without this threat of job loss. This contributes to the profits of the employer.


unemployment, involuntaryThe state of being out of work, but preferring to have a job at the wages and working conditions that otherwise identical employed workers have. See also: unemployment.

Involuntary unemployment
When we think about the implications of the labour discipline model for the whole economy, it tells us something else, which may at first seem surprising:

There must always be involuntary unemployment.

Being unemployed involuntarily means not having a job, although you would be willing to work at the wage that other workers like you are receiving.
In developing our model we assumed that Maria could expect to be unemployed for 44 weeks before receiving another wage offer at the same level. But the model implies that there must be an extended period of unemployment.
To see why, try to imagine an equilibrium in the game between Maria and her employer in which he pays her a wage of $12 per hour, and if she lost her job she could immediately find another at the same wage. In that case, Marias employment rent would be zero. She would be indifferent between keeping the job and losing it. So her best response would be an effort level of zero. But this could not be an equilibrium: the employer would not pay $12 an hour to someone who did no work.
If it were ever to happen that there were plenty of jobs available in the economy at $12 per hour, and no one was unemployed, such a situation could not last. Employers would offer higher wages to ensure that their workers had something to lose and would therefore work hard. But with higher wages, they would not be able to offer as many jobs. Workers who lost their jobs would no longer be able to find new ones easily. Jobs would be scarce and it might take weeks or months to find another. The economy would have moved to an equilibrium with higher wages and involuntary unemployment. Employees would be earning $16 an hour and those who lost their jobs would be willing to accept another at $16, but they would not immediately be able to find one.
In equilibrium, both wages and involuntary unemployment have to be high enough to ensure that there is enough employment rent for workers to put in effort.
Unemployment is an important concern for voters and the policymakers who represent them. We can use this model to see how policies that governments pursue to alter the level of unemployment, or to provide income to unemployed workers, will affect the profits of firms and the effort level of their employees.

Exercise 6.4 The employer sets the wage
Would any of the following affect Marias best response curve or the firms isocost lines for effort in Figure 6.6? If so, explain how.

The government decides to increase childcare subsidies for working parents but not for those unemployed. Assume Maria has a child and is eligible for the subsidy.
Demand for the firms output rises as celebrities endorse the good.
Improved technology makes Marias job easier.



Question 6.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 6.6 depicts the efficiency wage equilibrium of a worker and a firm. According to this figure:

Along the isocost line tangent to the best response curve, doubling of the per-hour effort from 0.45 to 0.90 would lead to an increased profit for the firm.
The slope of each isocost line is the number of units of effort per dollar.
At the equilibrium point, the marginal rate of transformation on the isocost line equals the marginal rate of substitution on the workers best response curve.
Points C and A both represent Nash equilibria because they are on the best response curve.


Along the isocost line, doubling effort requires doubling the wage. The cost of effort would not change, so profit would not change either.
Isocost lines have a constant ratio of effort to wage, e/w. Since e is on the vertical axis, and w is on the horizontal axis, the slope is e/w, which is the number of units of effort per dollar.
At the equilibrium point, the marginal rate of substitution between higher wage cost and higher effort on the isocost line equals the marginal rate of transformation of higher wages into greater effort on the workers best response curve.
At point C the workers choice of effort is a best response if the employer chooses this wage. But the employer would not be doing the best he could, given the workers strategy for choosing effort, so it is not a Nash equilibrium.
