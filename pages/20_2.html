20.1 Recap: External effects, incomplete contracts, and missing markets
The study of environmental economics began in Unit 1 of this course, where we saw that economic activity (the production and distribution of goods and services) takes place within the biological and physical system. As we saw in Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.12, the economy is embedded within society, but also within the ecosystem. Resources flow from nature into the human economy. Waste, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, or toxic sewage produced by firms and households, flows back into naturemainly into the atmosphere and the ocean. Scientific evidence suggests that the planet has a limited capacity to absorb the pollutants that the human economy generates. In this unit, we investigate the nature of the global ecosystem, which provides the resources that feed economic processes and the sinks where we dispose of our wastes.
In Unit 4, we introduced environmental problems at a local level, among people who were similar in most respects. Anil and Bala were neighbouring landowners with a pest management problem. They could choose between an environmentally damaging pesticide and benign pest management systems. The outcome was inefficient and environmentally destructive because they could not make a binding agreement (a complete and enforceable contract) in advance about how they would act. In Unit 4, we also discovered that contributing to sustaining the quality of the environment is, to some extent, a public good, and that there are strong self-interested motives to free ride on the activities of others. So, while everyone would benefit if we all contributed to protecting the environment, we often do not do our part.
When small numbers of individuals interact, however, we saw that informal agreements and social norms (a concern for the others wellbeing, for example) might be sufficient to address environmental problems. Examples found in real life include irrigation systems and the management of common land.
In Unit 12, we expanded the scope of environmental problems to include two groups of people pursuing different livelihoods. We considered a hypothetical pesticide called Weevokil (based, again, on real-world cases) and its effects on fishing and the jobs of workers who produce bananas. In this case, there was a missing marketthe plantation owners did not need to buy the right to pollute the fisheries, because they could do it for free. This is another case of an incomplete contract.
In cases like this, taxes can increase the polluters marginal private cost of production so that it equals the marginal social cost, resulting in the socially optimal level of production (and pollution). We canvassed a variety of solutions to the environmental problem (the external effects of the pesticide on the downstream fisheries), including bargaining between the organizations of fishermen and the plantation owners, and legislation (in the real-world case that inspired our Weevokil model, the government eventually banned the chemical).
Figure 20.5 reproduces a segment of Figure 12.8 that summarizes the nature of market failures in interactions between economic actors and the environment, and lists some possible remedies.

Cost or benefit
Market failure (misallocation of resources)
Possible remedies
Terms applied to this type of market failure




A firm uses a pesticide that runs off into waterways
Downstream damage
Private benefit, external cost
Overuse of pesticide and overproduction of the crop for which it is used
Taxes, quotas, bans, bargaining, common ownership of all affected assets
Negative external effect, environmental spillover


You take an international flight
Increase in global carbon emissions
Private benefit, external cost
Overuse of air travel
Taxes, quotas
Public bad, negative external effect

In this unit, we also consider the problem of climate change. Like the market failures above, climate change arises due to missing markets. However, unlike local environmental issues, climate change is global in scope. It involves people with vastly differing interests, ranging from those whose entire nation may be submerged by rising sea levels to those who profit from the production and use of the carbon-based energy that contributes to global climate change. We will see that many of the concepts developed already, such as feasible sets and indifference curves, apply in these cases as well.
The problem of climate change combines missing markets, uncertainty about its effect on the economy, the possibility of positive feedbacks and environmental tipping points, the need for international cooperation, and intergenerational issues. It is the greatest challenge of our time, and we need to use our entire toolkit (and more) to see how we can address it.

Question 20.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
Refer to Figure 20.5.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

Bargaining between affected parties is always effective in reducing the inefficiencies caused by externalities.
The market price of pesticides is unlikely to reflect the full social cost of their use.
All externalities result in the good producing the external effect being overused.
Reducing air travel is an unfortunate and inefficient by-product of taxing flights.


False. For instance, bargaining may not be effective when the number of people affected by the externality is very large. With climate change, those affected potentially includes everyone alive today as well as unborn future generations.
True. The market price will not reflect the additional costs imposed on downstream fisheries.
False. Negative externalities result in overuse, whereas positive externalities result in underuse.
False. Insofar as additional taxes reflect the social cost of air travel (due to emissions, noise pollution and so on), the reduction in air travel is economically efficient.
