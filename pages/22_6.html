22.5 Democracy as a political institution
We have seen that like firms, the government (treated in the model as if it were a single person) is an important economic actor. As an actor, the government imposes laws, fights wars, collects taxes, and provides public services such as the rule of law, stable currency, roads, healthcare, and schools. But, like firms, the government is also a stage. On the stage of government, politicians, political parties, soldiers, citizens, and bureaucrats interact according to the informal and formal rules that constitute political institutions.

The political institutions of a country are the rules of the game that determine who has power and how it is exercised in a society. Democracy is a political institution, which means it is a set of rules that determine

who makes up the government
the powers they can use when governing

Political institutions differ from country to country and over time. But major categories of political institutions include democracy and dictatorship.
The key value motivating democracy is political equality. Citizens should have substantially equal opportunities to be able to express their views in ways that can shape the policies and other activities of the government.
Democracy is sometimes advocated as a means to let the people rule, or in Abraham Lincolns words, a government of the people, by the people and for the people. But who the people are and what the people want is difficult to determine. Kenneth Arrow is the economist who contributed most to our understanding of the problems that elections sometimes encounter in selecting between different courses of action.

Great economists Kenneth Arrow

Kenneth Arrow (19212017) was born in New York City to Romanian-American parents. His essay A cautious case for socialism explains how the Great Depression and the Second World War influenced his ideas, especially those of freedom and avoidance of war.
A good summary of Kenneth Arrows explanation of the problems of using voting to determine which action is preferred, and his broader contributions to economics and social science, are in Steven Durlaufs essay Kenneth Arrow and the golden age of economic theory.8
In addition to his work on voting systems, he was among the first to demonstrate that there were conditions under which something like Adam Smiths invisible hand would work. Characteristically scholarly and detached from ideological rhetoric, he later wrote:

There is by now a long and imposing line of economists from Adam Smith to the present who have sought to show that a decentralized economy motivated by self interest and guided by price signals would be compatible with a coherent disposition of economic resources that could be regarded as superior to a large class of possible alternative dispositions. It is important to know not only whether it is true but whether it could be true. (original emphasis) (General Competitive Analysis, 1971)

Arrow was a pioneer in the study of many of the themes in The Economy, including asymmetric information and the economics of knowledge, and helped broaden the scope of economics to include insights from other disciplines. A year before his death, Arrow co-taught a course about inequality at Stanford University using an early draft of Unit 19 of this book, which was revised in light of his comments.

In Unit 1 we explained that we use the word democracy to refer to a form of government in which three political institutions exist:

Rule of law: All individuals are bound by the same laws, and nobodynot even the most powerful government officialis above the law.
Civil liberties: The members of a society are guaranteed rights of free speech, assembly, and the press.
Inclusive, fair, and decisive elections: Fair elections in which no major population group is excluded from voting, and after which the losing party leaves office.

Ideally, in a democracy those who have power are elected in an inclusive and open competitive process, and the rule of law and civil liberties limits the things they can do with that power.
Democracy has been advocated as a good political system on two quite different grounds:

Democracy in its own right: As a political system consistent with individual dignity and freedom.
Democracy as a way of addressing national problems: As a system that works better than other methods.

Here we focus on the consequences of democracy for addressing problems (the second point), not on its intrinsic merits (the first point).
No existing government fulfils the democratic ideal of political equality, where each citizen has equal influence over an outcome. Similarly, no government today can be said to perfectly match the three political institutions that define democracy.
Think about inclusive elections. Some population groupsthose convicted of major crimes, for exampleare excluded from voting in many countries, but we still consider the countrys political system as democratic. However, exclusion of a major population groupwomen, for example, as was common in recent historyis a sufficiently serious violation of the inclusive elections criterion to disqualify a country from the club of democratic nations. Some examples include:

West Bengal: To see how important restricting the right to vote can be, recall that in Unit 5, we examined the implementation of a land reform in West Bengal called Operation Barga and used the Lorenz curve to illustrate the effect of the reform in Figure 5.18. We can now see how inclusive elections could affect the likelihood that reforms like this take place. In the hypothetical case that only landowners have the vote, then if they vote in their own economic interests, they would not support a party pledged to implement such a reform (recall that in the example shown in Figure 5.18, the landowners share of the crop fell from 50% to 25% following the reform). Since the landowners make up only 10% of the population, if there was universal suffrage, the result would be different. The farmers making up the majority of the electorate would vote for a party proposing the land reform. In real life, the political party that introduced the reforms in West Bengal went on to win elections and, as a result, control of the state government for three decades.
The US: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured the vote for large numbers of effectively disenfranchised African American citizens. The result was a substantial shift in educational spending in districts with large numbers of previously excluded black voters.
Brazil: In Brazil, before the mid-1990s, casting a valid ballot required that voters could read and write reasonably well (which perhaps a quarter of the population could not). Around 11% of ballots cast were declared invalid due to communication barriers, most of them cast by poor voters. New electronic voting introduced in 1996 used pictures of candidates, an interface similar to phone keypads or ATM screens, and prompted the voter through the process step by step. The effect was to increase the number of valid votes made by the poor. The resulting change in the nature of the electorate led elected political leaders to prioritize the kinds of spending predominantly benefiting the less well off. Expenditure on public health, for example, increased by more than a third.9

As we will see in the following sections, how a government actually works is not determined solely by the presence or absence of civil liberties, the rule of law, and inclusive fair elections.
