13.8 Measuring the economy: Inflation
In Figures 13.20a and 13.20b we repeat the graphs from Figure 13.3, showing the growth rate of GDP and the unemployment rate in the UK from 1875 to 2014.

inflationAn increase in the general price level in the economy. Usually measured over a year. See also: deflation, disinflation.deflationA decrease in the general price level. See also: inflation.

In Figure 13.20c, we show the rate of inflation over this period. Inflation is an increase in the general price level in the economy, usually measured over a year. For the British economy, inflation ranges from a low level, with prices actually falling (called deflation) for much of the inter-war period before and after the Great Depression, to a peak of nearly 25% per annum in 1975.
Previously we saw that the downward spikes of economic crises were associated with upward spikes of unemployment; we now see that inflation was especially low in the 1930s and especially high in the 1970s. The peak in inflation followed the first of two oil price shocks (1973 and 1979) that were major disturbances to the global economy.

Figure 13.21 shows average rates of inflation in different regions of the world, and how they have changed over time. Upward spikes in inflation have tended to occur in periods of economic crisis, but the general trend worldwide since the 1970s has been a decline in inflation rates. The figure also shows that inflation tends to be higher in poor than in rich countries. For instance, since 2000, inflation has averaged 6.0% in sub-Saharan Africa and 6.6% in south Asia, in contrast to only 2.2% in the high-income OECD countries.

What is inflation?
Take your favourite chocolate bar. If its price goes up during the year from 50p to 55p, how do you know that is a symptom of inflation in the economy? It could just be that the chocolate bar has become more expensive relative to everything else, as a result of a rightward shift in the demand curve or a leftward shift in the supply curve of the kind we studied in Unit 8. To see what has happened to prices across the economy, take a giant shopping basket and fill it with every product and service that you buy in January. Has the price of this same giant basket increased when you check the prices in January the following year? And what about the baskets of other people?

consumer price index (CPI)A measure of the general level of prices that consumers have to pay for goods and services, including consumption taxes.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the general level of prices that consumers have to pay for goods and services, including consumption taxes. The basket of goods and services is chosen to reflect the spending of a typical household in the economy. For this reason, the change in the CPI, or CPI inflation, is often considered to measure changes in the cost of living.
The CPI is based on what consumers actually buy. It includes the prices of food and drink, housing, clothing, transportation, recreation, education, communications, medical care, and other goods and services. The goods and services in the basket are weighted according to the fraction of household spending they account for. The CPI excludes exports, which are consumed by foreign residents, but includes imports, which are consumed by households in the home economy. The change in the CPI over the past year is commonly used as a measure of inflation.

GDP deflatorA measure of the level of prices for domestically produced output. This is the ratio of nominal (or current price) GDP to real (or constant price) GDP.

The GDP deflator is a price index like the CPI, but it tracks the change in prices of all domestically produced final goods and services. Instead of a basket of goods and services, the GDP deflator tracks the price changes of the components of domestic GDP, that is, of C + I + G + X  M (the GDP deflator includes exports, which are produced by the home economy, but excludes imports, which are produced abroad).
The GDP deflator can also be expressed as the ratio of nominal (or current price) GDP to real (or constant price) GDP. The GDP deflator series is most commonly used to transform a nominal GDP series into a real GDP series. As we saw in Section 1.2 and Unit 1s Einstein section, the real GDP series shows how the size of the home economy changes over time, taking into account changes in the price of domestically produced goods and services.

Exercise 13.8 Measuring inflation
Go to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website, scroll to 2. The shopping basket and answer these questions:

How does a national statistical authority such as the ONS in the UK construct a giant representative shopping basket for the whole population?
If inflation this year is 2.5%, then what is the current price of the representative shopping basket that cost 100 last year?

The official national inflation rate does not necessarily reflect your own personal inflation rate. If you want to calculate your own personal inflation rate and how it deviates from the national one, some national statistics agencies offer a personal inflation calculator, such as Statistics Netherlands or Statistics South Africa. Your own office of national statistics may also have a personal inflation calculator.

Using a personal inflation calculator, calculate your personal inflation rate and comment on how and why it differs from the official inflation rate for your country.



Exercise 13.9 The CPI and the GDP deflator

Use the data from FRED to construct charts for annual real GDP growth (GDPC1), the unemployment rate (UNRATE), and the inflation rate (CPIAUCSL. Hint: how is the inflation rate calculated from the Consumer Price Index?) for the US. Select the period from 1960 until the most recent year available. In addition, download the data for the US GDP deflator (search for GDPDEF). Make sure your series are all in annual frequency. You can change the frequency by using the Edit graph button, above the top-right corner of your graph. You can watch this short tutorial to understand how FRED works.

Use the data you downloaded to answer the following questions (remember that the CPI is calculated from the price of goods consumed in the home country, while the GDP deflator is calculated from the price of the goods produced in the home country):

The main difference in the evolution of the series for the CPI and the GDP deflator takes place in 197475 and 19791982. What could explain this pattern? (Hint: think about the likely impact of an oil crisis on the price of imported goods and, in particular, on your own transport and fuel bills.)
What do you notice about the evolution of unemployment and inflation in the early 1980s?
Now construct the same charts for your own country. Write a brief report on the evolution of inflation, unemployment, and the real GDP growth rate over the same period.
