5.6 Allocations imposed by force
With the help of his gun, Bruno can choose any point in the lens-shaped technically feasible set of allocations. But which will he choose?
He reasons like this:

Bruno
For any number of hours that I order Angela to work, she will produce the amount of grain shown by the feasible frontier. But Ill have to give her at least the amount shown by the biological survival constraint for that much work, so that I can continue to exploit her. I get to keep the difference between what she produces and what I give her. Therefore I should find the hours of Angelas work for which the vertical distance between the feasible frontier and the biological survival constraint (Figure 5.5) is the greatest.


economic rentA payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or reservation option). See also: reservation option.

The amount that Bruno will get if he implements this strategy is his economic rent, meaning the amount he gets over what he would get if Angela were not his slave (which, in this model, we set at zero).
Bruno first considers letting Angela continue to work 8 hours a day, producing 9 bushels, as she did when she had free access to the land. For 8hours of work she needs 3.5 bushels of grain to survive. So Bruno could take 5.5 bushels without jeopardizing his future opportunities to benefit from Angelas labour.
Bruno is studying Figure 5.5 and asks for your help. You have noticed that the MRS on the survival constraint is less than the MRT at 8 hours of work:

You
Bruno, your plan cannot be right. If you forced her to work a little more, shed only need a little more grain to have the energy to work longer, because the biological survival constraint is relatively flat at 8hours of work. But the feasible frontier is steep, so she would produce a lot more if you imposed longer hours.

You demonstrate the argument to him using the analysis in Figure 5.5, which indicates that the vertical distance between the feasible frontier and the biological survival constraint is the greatest when Angela works for 11hours. If Bruno commands Angela to work for 11 hours, then she will produce 10 bushels and Bruno will get to keep 6 bushels for himself. We can use Figure 5.5 to find out how many bushels of grain Bruno will get for any technically feasible allocation.

Bruno can command Angela to work


Bruno can choose any allocation in the technically feasible set. He considers letting Angela continue working 8hours a day, producing 9 bushels.














When Angela works for 8 hours


Bruno could take 5.5 bushels without jeopardizing his future benefit from Angelas labour. This is shown by the vertical distance between the feasible frontier and the survival constraint.














The maximum distance between frontiers


The vertical distance between the feasible frontier and the biological survival constraint is greatest when Angela works for 11 hours (13 hours of free time).














Allocation and distribution at the maximum distance


If Bruno commands Angela to work for 11 hours, she will produce 10 bushels, and needs 4 to survive. Bruno will get to keep 6 bushels for himself (the distance AB).














At high working hours the survival frontier becomes steeper


If Bruno makes Angela work for more than 11 hours, the amount he can take falls as working hours increase.














The best Bruno can do for himself


Bruno gets the maximum amount of grain by choosing allocation B, where Angelas working time is such that the slope of the feasible frontier is equal to the slope of the biological survival constraint: MRT = MRS.














What Bruno gets


If we join up the points then we can see that the amount Bruno gets is hump-shaped, and peaks at 11 hours of work (13 hours of free time).




The lower panel in the last step in Figure 5.5 shows how the amount Bruno can take varies with Angelas free time. The graph is hump-shaped, and peaks at 13 hours of free time and 11 hours of work. Bruno maximizes his amount of grain at allocation B, commanding Angela to work for 11hours.
Notice how the slopes of the feasible frontier and the survival constraint (the MRT and MRS) help us to find the number of hours where Bruno can take the maximum amount of grain. To the right of 13 hours of free time (that is, if Angela works less than 11 hours) the biological survival constraint is flatter than the feasible frontier (MRS < MRT). This means that working more hours (moving to the left) would produce more grain than what Angela needs for the extra work. To the left of 13 hours of free time (Angela working more), the reverse is true: MRS > MRT. Brunos economic rent is greatest at the hours of work where the slopes of the two frontiers are equal.
That is:



Question 5.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.5 shows Angela and Brunos feasible frontier, and Angelas biological survival constraint.
If Bruno can impose the allocation:

He will choose the technically feasible allocation where Angela produces the most grain.
His preferred choice will be where the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) on the feasible frontier equals the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) on the biological survival constraint.
He will not choose 8 hours of work, because the MRS between Angelas work hours and subsistence requirements exceeds the MRT between work hours and grain output.
He will choose 13 hours of free time for Angela, and consume 10 bushels of grain.


At the technically feasible point where Angela produces the most grain, she needs all of the grain to survive, so there would be none for Bruno.
The distance between the feasible frontier and Angelas survival constraint, and thus Brunos share, is maximized where MRS = MRT.
At 8 hours of work (16 hours of free time) the feasible frontier is steeper than the biological survival constraint. Thus MRT > MRS.
Bruno would indeed choose 13 hours of free time for Angela, but the maximum he can claim without making Angela unable to work is 6 bushels of grain: the vertical distance between the feasible frontier and the survival constraint.


New institutions: Law and private property

private propertySomething is private property if the person possessing it has the right to exclude others from it, to benefit from the use of it, and to exchange it with others.

The economic interaction described in this section takes place in an environment where Bruno has the power to enslave Angela. If we move from a scenario of coercion to one in which there is a legal system that prohibits slavery and protects private property and the rights of landowners and workers, we can expect the outcome of the interaction to change.

powerThe ability to do (and get) the things one wants in opposition to the intentions of others, ordinarily by imposing or threatening sanctions.

In Unit 1, we defined private property as the right to use and exclude others from the use of something, and the right to sell it (or to transfer these rights to others). From now on we will suppose that Bruno owns the land and can exclude Angela if he chooses. How much grain he will get as a result of his private ownership of the land will depend on the extent of his power over Angela in the new situation.

economic rentA payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or reservation option). See also: reservation option.gains from exchangeThe benefits that each party gains from a transaction compared to how they would have fared without the exchange. Also known as: gains from trade. See also: economic rent.

When people participate voluntarily in an interaction, they do so because they expect the outcome to be better than their reservation optionthe next-best alternative. In other words, they do so in pursuit of economic rents. Economic rents are also sometimes called gains from exchange, because they are how much a person gains by engaging in the exchange compared to not engaging.

joint surplusThe sum of the economic rents of all involved in an interaction. Also known as: total gains from exchange or trade.bargaining powerThe extent of a persons advantage in securing a larger share of the economic rents made possible by an interaction.

The sum of the economic rents is termed the surplus (or sometimes the joint surplus, to emphasize that it includes all of the rents). How much rent they will each gethow they will share the surplusdepends on their bargaining power. And that, as we know, depends on the institutions governing the interaction.
In the example above, Angela was forced to participate and Bruno chose her working hours to maximize his own economic rent. Next we look at the situation where she can simply say no. Angela is no longer a slave, but Bruno still has the power to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer, just like the Proposer in the ultimatum game.
