1.1 Income inequality
A thousand years ago the world was flat, economically speaking. There were differences in income between the regions of the world; but as you can see from Figure 1.1a, the differences were small compared to what was to follow.
Nobody thinks the world is flat today, when it comes to income.
Figure 1.2 shows the distribution of income across and within countries. Countries are arranged according to GDP per capita from the poorest on the left of the diagram (Liberia), to the richest on the right (Singapore). The width of each countrys bars represents its population.
For every country there are ten bars, corresponding to the ten deciles of income. The height of each bar is the average income of 10% of the population, ranging from the poorest 10% of people at the front of the diagram to the richest 10% at the back, measured in 2005 US dollars. Note that this doesnt mean the richest 10% of income earners. It is the richest 10% of people, where each person in a household, including children, is assumed to have an equal share of the households income.
The skyscrapers (the highest columns) at the back of the right-hand side of the figure represent the income of the richest 10% in the richest countries. The tallest skyscraper is the richest 10% of people in Singapore. In 2014, this exclusive group had an income per capita of more than $67,000. Norway, the country with the second highest GDP per capita, does not have a particularly tall skyscraper (it is hidden between the skyscrapers for Singapore and the third richest country, the US) because income is more evenly distributed in Norway than in some other rich countries.
The analysis in Figure 1.2 shows how the distribution of income has changed since 1980.
























World income distribution in 2014


Figure 1.2 
Countries are ranked by GDP per capita from left to right. For each country the heights of the bars show average income for deciles of the population, from the poorest 10% at the front to the richest 10% at the back. The width of the bar indicates the countrys population.

The richest and poorest


In Singapore, the richest country on the furthest right, the average incomes of the richest and poorest 10% are $67,436 and $3,652 respectively. In Liberia, the furthest left, the corresponding incomes are $994 and $17.

Skyscrapers


The skyscraper bars in the back right of the figure are the richest 10% in some of the richest countries.

World income distribution in 1980


In 1980 the ranking of countries by GDP was different. The poorest countries, coloured darkest red, were Lesotho and China. The richest (darkest green) were Switzerland, Finland and then the US. At that time the skyscrapers were not as tall: the differences between the richest 10% and the rest of a countrys population were not as pronounced.

World income distribution in 1990


You can see from the colours that some countries changed their ranking between 1980 and 1990. China (dark red) is now richer; Uganda, also red, is in the middle of the distribution amongst countries coloured yellow. Some taller skyscrapers have appeared: inequality increased in many countries during the 1980s.

World income distribution in 2014


By 2014, many countries have changed their ranking. China has grown rapidly since 1990. But the countries that were richest in 1980 (darkest green) are still near the top in 2014.

Inequality within countries has risen


Income distributions have become more unequal in many of the richer countries: some very tall skyscrapers have appeared. In the middle-income countries, too, there is a big step up at the back of the figure: the incomes of the richest 10% are now high relative to the rest of the population.

The rich/poor ratio used here is similar to, but not exactly the same as, a commonly used measure of inequality called the 90/10 ratio. The 90/10 ratio is defined as the ratio between the income of the two individuals at the ninetieth and tenth percentiles. We are instead taking the ratio of the average income of the tenth (rich) and first (poor) deciles. The tenth decile is made up of all the people with higher income than the person at the ninetieth percentile, so its average is larger than the income of that person. The first decile is made of all the people with income less than the person at the tenth percentile, and so its average will be lower than the income of that person. Therefore, our rich/poor ratio will be a higher number than the 90/10 ratio for the same country.
Two things are clear from the 2014 distribution. First, in every country, the rich have much more than the poor. We can use the ratio between the heights of the front and back bars as one measure of inequality in a country. We will call it the rich/poor ratio, for obvious reasons. Even in a relatively equal country such as Norway, the rich/poor ratio is 5.4; in the US it is 16 and in Botswana in southern Africa it is 145. Inequality within the very poorest countries is difficult to see in the graph, but it is definitely there: the rich/poor ratio is 22 in Nigeria, and 20 in India.
The second thing that jumps out from Figure 1.2 is the huge difference in income between countries. Average income in Norway is 19 times the average income in Nigeria. And the poorest 10% in Norway receive almost twice the income of the richest 10% in Nigeria.
Imagine the traveller Ibn Battutas journey across regions of the world in the fourteenth century and think of how this would have looked in a diagram like Figure 1.2. He would of course notice that everywhere he went there were differences between the richest and poorest groups in the population of each region. He would report back that the differences in income between the countries of the world were relatively minor by comparison.











Countries that took off economically before 1900 (Figure 1.1a) are in the skyscraper part of Figure 1.2.
        




The vast differences in income between the countries of the world today take us back to Figure 1.1a, where we can begin to understand how this came about. The countries that took off economically before 1900UK, Japan, Italyare now rich. They (and countries like them) are in the skyscraper part of Figure 1.2. The countries that took off only recently, or not at all, are in the flatlands.

Exercise 1.1 Inequality in the fourteenth century
What do you think a skyscraper figure like Figure 1.2 would have looked like at the time of Ibn Battuta (early to mid-fourteenth century)?
Exercise 1.2 Working with income data
You can see the interactive graph and download the spreadsheet data that we used to create Figure 1.2. Choose five countries that you are interested in.

For each one calculate the rich/poor ratio in 1980, 1990 and 2014.
Describe the differences between countries and the changes over time that you find.
Can you think of any explanations for them?
