22.14 Special interests
In a democracy, it is often said that ideally the government is the servant of the people. In economic terms, government officials are the agents and the citizens are the principals.

principalagent relationshipThis relationship exists when one party (the principal) would like another party (the agent) to act in some way, or have some attribute that is in the interest of the principal, and that cannot be enforced or guaranteed in a binding contract. See also: incomplete contract. Also known as: principalagent problem.

But this immediately raises two questions:

Why would the agent (the elected official) do what the principals (the citizens) desire? As in any principalagent relationship the agent has his or her own objectives, and they differ from the principals objectives. Our model of the government as a monopolist illustrated how the government need not serve the interests of the people in an undemocratic society. We saw that the problem does not disappear in a democracy.
Who are the people? In economic terms, who is (or are) the principal(s)? Until now the principal has been the lender or the employer, which we could simplify by representing as a single individual. But there are many citizen-principals and they have differing priorities for what the government should do, whether the question is abatement of pollution, school improvement, policies to boost innovation, tax-funded transfers to the poor, and so on.

Democratic accountability of elected officials
Think about the first problemmotivating the elected official to do what the citizens preferas a principalagent problem, like the employer trying to motivate a worker to contribute to the profits of the firm. What are the possible solutions when the manager tries to motivate workers? The manager could:

Pay the agent an economic rent: She will fear losing it if she does an unsatisfactory job.
Monitor the work activity of the employee: To detect signs of inadequate work.
Replace the worker by another worker: If the work is found to be unsatisfactory.

In a democracy, elected officials are held accountable to the electorate by a similar set of strategies:

Give the official a sufficient salary, prestige, and other amenities of office: The official would then like to keep the job.
Monitor the activities of the government: To determine the quality of the governments performance using legal principles of transparency and judicial review, along with a free press and free speech.
Hold periodic elections: A government that has not performed well in the citizens eyes is replaced by a different set of political leaders.


short-termismThis subjective term refers to the case when the person making a judgement places too much weight on costs, benefits, and other things occurring in the near future than would be appropriate.

This is how democracies solve the principalagent problem of making elected officials accountable to the public. But it comes with a downside: the fact that officials, like employees, are subject to periodic review gives them an incentive to undertake projects whose objectives will become visible before the next election. This is called short-termism.
Governments, for example, sometimes introduce expansionary fiscal policies (cutting taxes or expanding spending) in the run-up to elections, so that disposable incomes will be rising and unemployment falling when people vote. Attempts to push employment above the long-run sustainable level (recall the labour market model) will eventually lead to unsustainable inflationary pressures. But these unwanted consequences would occur only after the election.
Because future elections are an incentive for short-term thinking by political leaders, a partial solution is to remove some policymaking from the hands of elected officials. This is the argument for an independent (not elected) judicial system, and for the political autonomy of the central bank.
For example, the governors of the US Federal Reserve system are appointed by the president for 14-year terms which are staggered, so that it is unlikely that a president will appoint many of them while in office. Figure 15.18 shows when central banks across countries in the world adopted inflation-targeting. This was a signal of a greater degree of autonomy of central bank decision making. Also in the US, presidential appointments to the Supreme Court are for life.
Policymaking in a democracy is also sometimes biased in favour of smaller groups. Here is the reason. Consider a policy, such as a reduction in tariffs on imports of clothing, which will make less-expensive clothing available to the population but reduce the employment and income of workers in the domestic clothing industry. Suppose that it will confer a total of 1 million of costs on the 500 clothing workers and at the same time will confer 2 million of benefits on 2 million consumers of clothing.
Now consider the challenges facing those seeking to organize campaigns against and for the policy:

Each worker in the domestic indstry would lose 2,000 a year if the legislation were passed, so most would support the anti-import cause, and be against the tariff reduction.
Each consumer would benefit by 1 if the legislation were passed, so few people would be willing even to send an email to their legislator.

All animals are equal. But some are more equal than others.
This quote is from George Orwells 1945 book Animal Farm, which was a satirical critique of Joseph Stalins dictatorship of the Soviet Union. But it also applies to how democracies work in practice. All citizens are legally equal in their rights, but some have much more power to influence government policy than others.20
This concerns the second question at the beginning of this section: when persuading elected officials to favour one policy over another, citizens are far from equal. Wealthy citizens in particular may have a disproportionate voice in a democracy because:

Wealthy citizens invest: Their decisions about investment (the case of Chile, for example) may determine the fate of a government.
Wealthy citizens donate to politicians: Their contributions to electoral campaigns (in countries where this is allowed), or even direct personal payments, may influence either who is elected or what the elected officials do once in office.
Wealthy citizens control communications: Some own and direct newspapers and TV stations.
Wealthy citizens employ lobbyists: They, or the firms they own, employ professionalsoften former politiciansto influence elected officials.

The result is that economic inequality feeds political inequality, which in turn feeds economic inequality.
For evidence on how political contributions (as well as special interests) influenced US housing market policy prior to the crisis, read: Atif Mian, Amir Sufi, and Francesco Trebbi. 2013. The Political Economy of the Subprime Mortgage Credit Expansion. Quarterly Journal of Political Science 8: pp.373408.
For example, the relationship between economic inequality and political inequality affects gender outcomes. In many countries, women participate much less in political life and leadership than men. In India, the reservation of positions for women to head village councils has been shown to increase public spending on the public services that women prefer, like wells, so that they do not have to carry water so far. It also reduces receipts of bribes by those in power and was found to transform stereotypes. Men in villages that were randomly reserved for women leaders subconsciously perceived women more positively as leaders, as compared with viewing them solely in domestic roles.

In our Economist in action video, Esther Duflo explains what happened when it was mandated that randomly selected villages elect a woman to head their local council.



How economists (and political scientists) learn from facts Does money talk?
In the US, people often say money talks. Many are concerned that it talks particularly loudly when it comes to politics.
To some, it is obvious that when a candidate for political office receives a large contribution for his electoral campaign from a business, or a trade union with an economic interest at stake, the candidate will be more likely to take the side of the contributor when it comes to using political power to influence policy.
We know the election campaigns for the US congress in 2012 spent on average $8.5 million per congressional seat, as a paper on procuring access to congressional representatives relates. But did the winners provide favours for the donors that would not have occurred without the donors contributions?
We might ask if the members of congress who received contributions from those with investments in the oil industry tended to favour the interests of those firms afterwards. Or did those receiving funds from trade union members support an agenda that favoured the unions interests? The answer in both cases would be that they did.
But this does not demonstrate that donor contributions purchased influence over the legislator. Remember causation can work both ways: those with oil wealth are likely to donate to candidates who already favour that industrys interests. Trade union members will donate money to those who already support the interests of trade unions. Simply showing a correlation between the source of the funding and the policies supported by the legislator does not show that the contributions caused the legislator to act differently.
Political scientists Joshua Kalla and David Brockman designed a clever experiment to see if the donation caused the congress member to behave in the donors interest. They reasoned that citizens could influence legislators by meeting with them and expressing their views. Members of Congress are busy people, so gaining access to them for a meeting is something that groups compete for.21
They wanted to find out if those who gave money to a congress member were more likely to be granted a meeting. With the cooperation of a (real) interest group Credo Action, they contacted 191 members of congress to ask for a meeting. All of the constituents making this request had contributed some funds to the members campaign. The control group, randomly chosen, and half of the total sample, said only that they were residents of the members district. The treatment group also identified themselves as donors. All callers in both groups read from a script, so the requests for a meeting were otherwise identical.
Among those not identified as donors, 2.4% gained a meeting with either the congress member or the chief of staff. For those identified as donors, 12.5% got a meeting.
The authors concluded:

The vast majority of Americans who cannot afford to contribute to campaigns in meaningful amounts are at a disadvantage when attempting to express their concerns to policy makers.


Special interests: The story of Chile continued
What happened after the election of Allende in Chile in 1970 tells a story not only of economic limits to feasible policies, but also of political limits.
Amid faltering economic performance, due in part to potential investors holding back on investment in Chile, opposition to Allende mounted, some of it supported in secret by the US government. In 1973, the Chilean armed forces attacked the presidential palace, defeating troops loyal to Allende. They took over the government, ending democracy and replacing Allende with the unelected General Augusto Pinochet.

Time zero is the first trading day on the Santiago stock market following the military takeover.



The wealthy anticipated that Pinochet would introduce pro-business policies, so stock prices rose again (Figure 22.20a). The Pinochet dictatorship would remain until a constitutional referendum in 1988 demanded a return to democracy, which the armed forces respected.
Once again, a sharp change in behaviour of the wealthy is recorded in the stock market prices on the day following the referendum.

Allendes economic program was infeasible for two reasons:

It was economically infeasible: He could not force private firms to invest in Chile, and without their investment the economy would stagnate or even shrink.
It was politically infeasible: Though democratically elected he did not control the Chilean armed forces which, with the support of businesses and the US Central Intelligence Agency, turned against him.
