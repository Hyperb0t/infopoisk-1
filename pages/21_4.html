21.3 External effects: Complements, substitutes, and coordination

complementsTwo goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other. See also: substitutes.substitutesTwo goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. See also: complements.

Innovations considered by a firm will typically either increase or decrease other firms profit levels, and affect those firms choices about innovation. Think about just two firms, each considering innovations that are either:

Complements: The value of one innovation is greater in the presence of the other. Tin cans were invented to store food in 1810 by Peter Durand, a British merchant, and the first canning factory began production in 1813. But the cans were very difficult to open and not widely used in the home until 1858, when Ezra Warner invented a simple can opener.
Substitutes: The two innovations are valuable alone, but less valuable when some other innovation has already occurred. A good example is the video format war during the 1980s between two competing standards, VHS and Betamax. Videos made using one format could not be played on machines designed to play the other. Either Sony Betamax or JVCs rival VHS would have been a perfectly good single format for home video recording, but the introduction of both led to a costly rivalry.

In the absence of explicit government policies or private means of coordination among firms, the challenges posed by complementary innovations and substitute innovations are quite different:

When potential innovations are complements: Innovations sometimes do not occur even when it would have been socially beneficial, and profitable to the firms, if they had both occurred.
When potential innovations are substitutes: Both innovations sometimes occur, when having only one or the other would be more socially beneficial and profitable to the firms involved. Competition between substitutes may impose a high cost on both innovators.

We can use game theory to understand how two potential innovating firms interact strategically, and show why these contrasting problems arise and why they may be difficult to solve. (You may wish to review the introduction to game theory in Unit 4.)
Innovations that are complements
Here we have two hypothetical firms, Plugcar, which is considering developing a novel electric car, and Netflex, which is weighing up the likely profits and costs of investing in a mobile network of battery exchanges. As above, the presence of Netflex makes Plugcar more valuable and vice versa, so they are complements. They will make their decisions (Innovate or Do not innovate) independently, but they know the profits and losses that will result in each of the four possible outcomes. They are given in the payoff matrix below. The row player is Plugcar, and its payoffs come first in each cell; the column player is Netflex, its payoffs are second in each cell. Positive numbers are profits for the company, while negative numbers are losses.

Begin with the row player


Begin with the row player and ask: What would be the best response to the column players decision to innovate?














The best response


The best response would be Innovate, since the payoff is 1 rather than 0. Place a dot in the top left-hand cell.














The row players response


Then ask what the row players best response would be to the column players choice of Do not innovate: the answer is Do not innovate. Place a dot in the bottom right-hand cell.














The column players reasoning


Now turn to the column player. What would be the best response to the row players strategy of Innovate? The answer is Innovate. Place an open circle in the top left-hand cellthere will now be a dot inside a circle.














The column players response


Do the same for the column players response to row players strategy of Do not innovate. There is now a dot inside a circle.














Finding the Nash equilibria


Wherever there is a dot inside a circle in a cell, this is a Nash equilibrium because it shows that each player is playing the best response to what the other does.




Imagine that you are Plugcar. If you do not innovate you will get zero, whatever Netflex does. If you knew that Netflex was not going to introduce its product, then you surely would not develop the Plugcar. What if Netflex does introduce its product? If you innovate you will get profits of 1. But you also stand to incur losses of 0.5 if Netflex does not innovate.
Unless you are pretty sure that Netflex is going to innovate, you may decide that you have better uses for your funds. If Netflex reasoned the same way, then neither firm might innovate even though they both would have profited from doing so.
Innovations that are substitutes
When two innovations are substitutes we have the opposite problem. A good example is the video format war during the 1980s between two competing standards, VHS (for video home system developed by Victor Company of Japan (JVC)) and Sonys Betamax format. As discussed above, videos using one format could not be played on machines designed to play the other, so both companies had an interest in making their format the most widely accepted.
We consider two hypothetical firms based on the Sony-JVC case. Here is the payoff matrix facing them. JVC is the row player, and Sony is the column player. As before, the first entry in each cell is the payoff of the row player.












Figure 21.7 
The decision to innovate when products are substitutes.
        















Begin with the row player


Begin with the row player and ask: What would be the best response to the column players decision to innovate?














The best response


The best response would be Do not innovate, since the payoff is 0.5 rather than 1.0. Place a dot in the bottom left-hand cell.














The row players response


Then ask what the row players best response would be to the column players choice of Do not innovate: the answer is Innovate. Place a dot in the top right-hand cell.














The column players reasoning


Now turn to the column player. What would be the best response to the row players strategy of Innovate? The answer is Do not innovate. Place an open circle in the bottom left-hand cellthere will now be a dot inside a circle.














The column players response


Do the same for the column players response to row players strategy of Do not innovate. There is now a dot inside a circle.














Finding the Nash equilibria


Wherever there is a dot inside a circle in a cell, this is a Nash equilibrium because it shows that each player is playing the best response to what the other does.




If Sony is sure that JVC will innovate, then it will face a costly battle with big losses if JVC wins. The payoffs in the upper left-hand cell are negative for both firms, because the costs of developing the new product and competing for market share do not offset the uncertain prospect of profits should they win. Of course, if Sony knew that JVC was not going to invest, or if it was sure it would win a not-very-costly battle with its product should both invest, then Sony would definitely invest and enjoy the winner-take-all profits, while inflicting losses on JVC.
The result is that there is sometimes too little innovation for the good of society when ideas are complementary, and too much when the innovations are substitutes.
The role of public policy
Complements
If the payoffs in the matrix were known to everyone, then a wise government would know that the top left (Innovate, Innovate) in Figure 21.6 is the best outcome for society. It could, in the case of complementary innovations, provide both firms with sufficient subsidies so that both would find it profitable to make the investment regardless of what the other firm did. Or, more reasonably, it could help the two firms to cooperate in the innovation process, promising not to prosecute them for any anti-competitive practices if coordinated decision making is prohibited by antitrust or other law.
But using public policy to avoid an unfavourable outcome is a greater challenge than our simple model would suggest. There are likely to be more than two potential innovators, and hence many proposed designs for electric cars and for recharging systems. The government would have to choose the cooperating firms, and the terms under which the cooperation would occur. In this case, companies have incentives to spend resources to influence government decisions (lobbying). As we shall see in Unit 22, there are many reasons why governments may fail to achieve the socially beneficial outcome in cases like this.
Private exchanges might have a role to play here. If the firms themselves have better information than the government, they might engage in private agreements. This is the equivalent to the bargaining among private economic bodies that occurred in Unit 12 as an alternative to government regulation of the use of chemical weedkillers.
Finally, firms with promising complementary innovations might agree to merge so that, as a single company, the problem of coordinating their innovation decisions would be internal to the firm.
Substitutes and standards
The substitutes in Figure 21.7 present similar challenges for government policy. There may be a great many competing substitute innovations. Sonys Betamax and JVCs VHS were not the only entrants in the early stages of the formatting wars. Governments may also lack the relevant information, or may be under the influence of one of the contestants.
As we will see later, sometimes one competitors technology wins over the other. Eventually, Betamax, for example, died out and VHS became the universal home videotape standard. Sometimes, companies in an industry apply the same standards, because consistency increases the size of the market and benefits all firms. An example is the way the shipping industry implemented the standard for the size of containers they carry, which allowed trucks and ports to become more efficient, and therefore achieve economies of scale.
Often, however, public sector agencies play an important role in encouraging agreement among all the firms in an industry about technical standards. These are usually international bodies, like the International Telecommunications Union or the European Commission. The EU, for example, helped mobile phone companies to agree on the GSM standard for phone handsets and networks, which enabled all the manufacturers and operators to benefit from a rapidly growing European mobile market, and enabled consumers to benefit from the ease of calling other networks and declining prices.

Exercise 21.4 Complements

List some pairs of innovations that are complements, and some that are substitutes.
In the game in Figure 21.6, what probability of one firm choosing Innovate would make it profitable for the other firm to choose Innovate? Explain your answer. (Hint: Compare the expected payoffs of choosing either option, given that the probability of the other firm choosing Innovate is x. What range of probabilities would give a higher expected payoff from choosing Innovate?)



Exercise 21.5 Substitutes and complements

Go back to Figure 4.16a and consider the game between Bettina and Astrid, in which they choose whether to use two different programming languages, C++ and Java. Describe the similarities and differences in the strategies, payoffs, and optimal outcome of Figure 4.16 and the Sony-JVC game depicted here.
In Figure 21.7, for innovating to be profitable, with what probability should the other firm choose Do not innovate?

Now suppose that decisions in Figures 21.6 and 21.7 are made sequentially rather than simultaneously. In the case of substitutes (Sony and JVC), imagine that JVC developed its product and put it on the market (or at least convinced Sony that it would definitely do this). In the case of complements (Plugcar and Netflex), assume that Plugcar could convince Netflex that it will definitely bring the new electric car to the market.

Explain what the outcome in those cases would be if the two firms made their decisions sequentially rather than simultaneously.



Question 21.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following matrix shows the payoffs for two firms according to whether they innovate or not. The first number is the payoff for firm A while the second number is for firm B.












Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

In this game, the two innovations are complements.
There are two Nash equilibria in this game: (Innovate, Innovate) and (Do not innovate, Do not innovate).
Firm B will definitely choose to innovate because of the potentially high profits from innovation.
Firm A will choose to innovate if the probability of Firm B investing is 75% or less.


The payoff of ones innovation is decreased by innovation of the other. Therefore the two are substitutes.
The two Nash equilibria in this game are (Innovate, Do not innovate) and (Do not innovate, Innovate).
Firm B incurs a large loss if firm A also innovates. It is therefore not certain that firm B would innovate.
If the probability that Firm B chooses Innovate is x%, then Firm A gets x + 1.5(1  x) by choosing Innovate, compared to 0.5x by choosing Not innovate. Firm A prefers to innovate if x + 1.5(1  x) > 0.5x, which is true if x < 0.75.
