18.6 Winners and losers from trade and specialization
Carlos and Greta both benefit from trade, so why are imports and exports often controversial? Unlike our story, in the real world there are almost always winners and losers. The processes of specialization and exchange affect regions, industries, and household types differently. Had the bakers and shoppers of Genoa known that cheap grain was aboard the Manila they would have cheered her into port, while local farmers may have secretly prayed for a shipwreck.
Nations are composed of people with differing economic interests. They are not like our islands with only Greta and Carlos. Therefore, to understand these issues we need to go further than assuming a single individual or a set of identical individuals inhabits each nation.
To think about winners and losers from trade, we begin with a model of two stylized countries, which we call the US and China, where specialization is based on factor endowments. The US is an advanced economy with a long tradition of manufacturing. China is less developed, but has become the worlds second-largest economy by exporting manufactured goods. Let us imagine, unrealistically, that the US and China produce only two goods, which are produced under constant returns to scale: passenger aircraft and consumer electronics (like games consoles, personal computers, and TVs). Furthermore, we assume (more realistically this time) that the US has an absolute advantage in producing both goods, and a comparative advantage in producing aircraft.
We assume that aircraft production is capital-intensive and that capital is relatively abundant in the US. In contrast, China has a comparative advantage in consumer electronics production, which is more labour-intensive and China has an abundance of labour relative to capital. Given these assumptions, when the economies begin to trade with one another, the US will specialize in the production of aircraft, whereas China will specialize in the production of consumer electronics.
Opening trade between the US and China in aircraft and consumer electronics has the following effects:

It increases the consumption possibility set for both countries.
Conflicts of interest emerge between the countries.
Conflicts of interest emerge within each country.

As we have seen, the relative price of the two goods affects how the gains from trade are divided between the countries. The usual forces of demand and supply affect the relative price, but the balance of bargaining power between the two affects the price too. For the US and China, and all other countries in the real world, relative prices are subject to the same forces. In Unit 15, for example, we investigated the macroeconomic consequences of oil price shocks. But what caused the increase in the relative price of oil?

cartelA group of firms that collude in order to increase their joint profits.


The first and second oil shocks (1970s): Relative price increases were due to political developments in the Middle East and to the ability of oil producers to exert monopoly power through a cartel. The exercise of monopoly power by producers shifted the supply curve upward.
The third oil shock (2000s): The growth of China and other emerging economies caused a large increase in global demand. The global demand curve for oil shifted to the right.

The beneficiaries of a rise in relative price are the inhabitants of the country that specializes in producing that product. But do all citizens benefit? Not everyone in a country is the same. For example, some people have only their labour to sell. Others have accumulated wealth, which they can use to invest in firms.
In the example of the US and China, after trade the US specializes in producing aircraft and China specializes in consumer electronics. Trade and specialization mean that resources shift from one industry to another. Workers previously employed in electronics in the US must try to find work in the expanding aircraft manufacturing businesses. Similarly, in China, employment will expand in consumer electronics production. In the short run at least, those workers employed in the industry that their nation does not specialize in will lose out. For now, let us ignore any effect that trade has on the total size of the economy. We will return to this shortly.
The increase in production of aircraft in the US increases the demand for the factor of production used intensively in that industry: capital. In China, it increases demand for labour instead.

The winners in the US: The owners of capital benefit more from trade than workers, because capital becomes relatively scarce as production of aircraft rises. Since the wealthy tend to hold proportionally more of their wealth in capital than the poor, we would predict a rise in inequality.
The winners in China: Workers are in higher demand as consumer electronics production expands. Wages rise as firms compete for workers. As we have seen in Unit 6, lower unemployment lowers the cost of job loss, and firms raise wages. Workers benefit more from trade than the owners of capital, hence we would expect inequality to fall.

Trade and specialization in the US involves transferring labour and capital from electronics production to aircraft production. Think of what happens when one unit of capital, such as a factory, shifts from electronics to aircraft production. An electronics factory closes, laying off X workers, and an aircraft factory opens, hiring Y workers. Which is bigger, X or Y?
The answer: X is bigger than Y, since one unit of capital provides the tools and equipment necessary to employ more workers in electronics than in aircraft production (since electronics is relatively labour-intensive). Thus, when capital shifts from electronics production to aircraft production, there is a net loss of jobs. This is of course also assuming that workers do not need to re-skill and, more generally, that there are no other frictions in the labour market. These factors would result in a greater loss of jobs in the short run.
In this case, US workers are losing out, and US employers are winning. Workers are working for lower wages, and profits rise. The effect of imports of labour-intensive electronics and the shift in US production to less labour-demanding goods (aircraft) is that employers capture most of the gains from trade. As consumers of electronics, both employers and workers benefit. This is an example of a general principle about who benefits from international trade: The owners of relatively scarce factors of production in their own country prior to trade (US labour in our example) lose from specialization and trade, and the owners of relatively abundant factors (owners of capital in the US) gain.
The reasoning behind this principle is as follows:

Factors that are relatively scarce in their own countries, compared with in the rest of the world, are relatively expensive compared to prices elsewhere when there is no trade. When their economies start trading with the rest of the world their price is dragged down towards the world average, because they are effectively competing with their abundant counterparts in the rest of the world.
The same reasoning applies in reverse to factors that are relatively abundant in their own countries relative to the rest of the world.

So, in the US in this example, workers are initially relatively scarce and lose from trade, while employers gain; in China workers are initially relatively abundant and gain from trade, while employers lose. The key to understanding this is to focus on the change in relative scarcity once labour and capital embodied in traded goods and services can flow across borders.
This, however, ignores the overall increase in the size of the economy resulting from trade. This could benefit everyone in the economy and could therefore offset the losses experienced by the disadvantaged group (in this case, the US workers).
Figure 18.20 illustrates the two dimensions of conflict arising from international trade.











Figure 18.20 
The winners and losers from trade between the US and China.
        




On the left we have the US and Chinese economies with limited specialization and trade. To make comparison easy, the economies are normalized to a size of one, and the numbers in the pies show both the proportion and size (in brackets) of the slice of the economic pie that accrue to workers (red) and the owners of capital (blue). On the right we show the US and Chinese economies with greater specialization and trade.
The gains from specialization and trade are clear from the fact that the total size of each economy on the right is larger. The size of the US economy has increased by 30% and the size of the Chinese economy has increased by 40%. The prices at which they have traded (as determined by bargaining) have resulted, in this case, in China securing more of the gains from trade.
But notice too that Chinas shift into labour-intensive electronics has raised labours share of Chinas larger pie, and reduced the share of profits. Both capital and labour in China are, however, better off with higher specialization and trade, as the absolute size of the slices going to workers and the owners of capital have both increased (0.5 < 0.84 and 0.5 < 0.56).
The story is different in the US. The owners of capital goods (employers) now have a larger slice of the USs larger pie, but the US workers slice is not only proportionally smaller (75% > 55%), but also smaller in absolute size (0.75 > 0.715). So even after we take the growth of the economy into account, US workers are the losers. US employers, Chinese employers, and Chinese workers are all winners.
The same logic would continue to apply if we considered other factors of production. For example, consider two industries that require employees with different levels of skills and education: a skill-intensive industry (information technology) and a non skill-intensive industry (consumer electronics assembly). If a rich economy, relatively abundant in skilled labour, starts trading with a poor, unskilled, labour-abundant country, then unskilled workers in rich countries (and skilled workers in poor countries) will lose out relative to skilled workers in rich countries (and unskilled workers in poor countries), who will gain.
You might think that this would affect the way that different groups viewed trade. Indeed, there is considerable survey evidence that unskilled workers in rich countries are more protectionist than skilled workers, but unskilled workers in poor countries are more in favour of trade than skilled workers. Of course, as illustrated in Figure 18.20, if the gains from trade are large enough it could still be the case that the members of the group that is relatively less well off within a country are made better off in absolute terms by the specialization and trade.
The example of the US and China shown in this section does not only have relevance for the wave of globalization after 1945. One hundred years ago, when Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, two Swedish economists, were working on better understanding patterns of specialization and trade, they were motivated by the globalization of the late nineteenth century. One difference between then and now is the factors of production involved. While our example of the US and China focused on capital- and labour-intensive manufactured goods, the globalization of the late nineteenth century involved the exchange of land-intensive agricultural goods (food and raw materials such as cotton) for labour-intensive manufactures.
The agricultural goods were exported by land-abundant (and labour-scarce) countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Russia; the manufactured goods were exported by labour-abundant (and land-scarce) countries in northwest Europe, such as Britain, France, and Germany. In this context, the big losers were European landowners and workers in land-abundant regions; the big winners were European workers and the owners of land in the New World and other land-abundant economies. In Unit 2 we saw that workers in England gained economically, relative to landowners, from the middle of the nineteenth century onwards.
The same happened in other land-scarce, labour-abundant societies in Europe and elsewhere (for example, Japan). Meanwhile, the ratio of land rents to wages rose strongly in land-abundant, labour-scarce regions: not just the New World economies mentioned earlier, but also in areas such as the Punjab, which was a major exporter of agricultural products.
Not surprisingly, European landowners objected to this, and in countries such as France and Germany they succeeded in getting governments to impose tariffs on agricultural imports. There was thus a political backlash against globalization. Governments raised trade costs in the form of tariffs to counteract the impact of the fall in other trade costs, notably transportation.

Exercise 18.7 Winners and losers from specialization due to economies of scale
Suppose there are two countries that are identical in their factor endowments. Both would like to consume both passenger cars and commercial vehicles, industries in which there are economies of scale. In the absence of trade, each country would have both industries. If they could trade, both could benefit by specializing and taking advantage of economies of scale to lower their costs of production.
Assume that once trade becomes possible, country A specializes in producing passenger cars and country B specializes in producing commercial vehicles. Because of economies of scale, the cost of passenger cars relative to commercial vehicles is lower in country A than in countryB.


Explain why we would expect to observe trade in similar products, known as intra-industry trade, when production technology is characterized by economies of scale.


Who are the winners and losers in this example? How does your result compare with that of the winners and losers in the example of the US and China, where specialization is based on relative factor endowments?




Question 18.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.20 is a diagram that describes the effects of trade on the employers and the workers in the US and China. The initial size of each economy is normalized to one. The US has the comparative advantage in the capital-intensive goods, while China has the comparative advantage in the labour-intensive goods. As a result of trade the USs economy is assumed to grow by 30% and that of China by 40%.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

Specialization means that China will produce all the capital-intensive goods.
The US has the stronger bargaining power in the determination of the relative price after trade.
In the US, the employers are better off while the workers are worse off as a result of trade.
In China, the workers are better off while the employers are worse off as a result of trade.


Specialization means that the US will produce all the capital-intensive goods, in which it has the comparative advantage.
The fact that Chinas economy grew by a larger percentage suggests that it has the stronger bargaining power.
Employers in the US are better off since they now have a larger slice of a bigger pie (0.585 > 0.25). Even though the total size of the pie has increased, the share received by workers has fallen by such an amount that they are worse off (0.715 < 0.75).
In China, while the share of the pie claimed by the capitalists is smaller after the trade, its absolute size is still increased. Therefore both the workers and the capitalists are better off.



Exercise 18.8 The collapse of the Soviet Union
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Soviet Union collapsed. The Soviet Union comprised Russia and some of the countries that now make up eastern Europe and central Asia. It was a planned economy, run from Moscow by the Communist Party. Following this collapse, countries in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the former Soviet blocwith a total of close to 300 million workersopened their borders to international trade.


Assume that Germany was a capital-intensive country, while the former Soviet bloc states were labour-intensive. Use the analysis in this section to identify likely winners and losers from this shock to global trade in:

Germany
the countries of the former Soviet bloc



What other information would you need to know about these countries to identify the actual winners and losers?
