9.9 Labour supply, labour demand, and bargaining power
Even though the supply of labour must always exceed demand for labour at the labour market equilibrium (there is always some involuntary unemployment), the supply of labour is still one of the important determinants of this Nash equilibrium. To see why this is so, imagine that there is immigration of people looking for employment (assume these immigrants are potential employees, as opposed to people who intend to start up a business), or that people who have stayed at home to raise children, or have retired, re-join the labour force.
What effect would this have? Lets look first at what happens to the wage-setting curve following an increase in labour supply:

new jobseekers would enter the pool of unemployed
which would increase the expected duration of a spell of unemployment
by raising the cost of job loss, this increases the employment rent enjoyed by employed workers at the current wage and level of employment
but firms would then be paying more than necessary to ensure worker motivation on the job
 therefore firms would lower their wages

This process is true for any point on the wage-setting curve, so it must be true of the entire curve. Therefore, the effect of an increase in labour supply is to shift the wage-setting curve downward.
Changes in labour supply: The effects of immigration
We use an increase in the labour supply due to immigration as an example. The labour supply curve would shift to the right, as shown in Figure 9.19.

The effect of immigration on unemployment.
        















The initial situation


The economy starts at point A, employing 4 million workers at a wage of $20 per hour and a labour force of 5million.














One million workers are unemployed


This is shown by the distance U.














Immigrant workers join the labour force


This increases the labour force from 5million to 5.5 million workers.














The wage-setting curve shifts downward


At any level of employment there are now more unemployed workers. The rise in unemployment to 1.5 million is shown by distance U. The threat of job loss is greater and firms can secure effort from the workforce at a lower wage.














Firms lower the wage


The wage is now set at point B on the wage-setting curve in the figure, with the wage at $13 an hour and employment still at 4 million.














Profits rise


This causes firms to hire more workers, which requires rising wages along the wage-setting curve. The labour market moves from point B to point C.














Employment and wages rise


They rise until they reach the price-setting curve, meaning profits are consistent with market competition again. At point C, employment is 4.5 million workers, the wage is $20, and unemployment has fallen back to 1million workers, as shown by distance U.




In this story, the short-run impact of immigration is bad for existing workers in that country: wages fall and the expected duration of unemployment increases. In the long run, however, the increased profitability of firms leads to expanded employment that eventually (if no further changes take place) will restore the real wage and return the economy to its initial rate of unemployment. As a result, incumbent workers are no worse off. Immigrants are likely to be economically better off tooespecially if they left their home country because it was difficult to make a living.
We summarize the effects of the increase in labour supply on the labour market:

The shift downward in the wage-setting curve at the initial level of employment lowered the wage (to B).
The reduction in the wage results in a reduction in the firms marginal costs and with no change in the firms demand conditions, the firms will hire additional workers.
As a result, employment expands so that once again the economy is at the intersection of the price-setting curve and the new wage-setting curve, with higher employment.
The increase in labour supply leads to a new equilibrium at higher employment because it shifts the wage-setting curve down. New hiring stops when the wage is once again at the level shown by the price-setting curve (at C). In the new equilibrium, employment is higher and the real wage is unchanged.


Exercise 9.6 Immigration of entrepreneurs
Suppose that some of the immigrants to the country decide to set up businesses, rather than become employees. Explain how you expect this to affect the wage-setting curve, the price-setting curve, and the labour market equilibrium.


Question 9.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 9.17 depicts the model of a labour market where there are 90 million workers. The current labour market equilibrium is at A. Now consider the case where the total labour supply is increased to 100 million. Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct regarding the adjustment process in the labour market?

Initially, unemployment doubles.
Higher unemployment results in a reduction in the employment rent enjoyed by workers employed at the current wage.
The firms are required to raise wages to induce workers to work hard.
The wage-setting curve shifts downward.


Before the labour supply increase there are 10 million unemployed. With the extra 10 million workers joining the labour supply, unemployment initially doubles to 20 million workers.
Higher unemployment means that it is more costly for the workers to be unemployed. Therefore there is an increase in the employment rent enjoyed by those employed.
Higher unemployment implies higher employment rent. This means that firms are able to pay a lower wage and can still induce workers to work hard.
Higher unemployment implies higher employment rent. This means that firms are able to pay a lower wage and can still induce workers to work hard. This is true of any point on the wage-setting curve, and therefore the wage-setting curve shifts downward.
