19.1 Inequality across the world and over time
As you know from Unit 5, we can use Lorenz curves to estimate Gini coefficients, which measure the degree of inequality in wealth, income, earnings (income from work in the form of salaries and wages), years of schooling, and other indicators of economic or social success.
Wealth, earnings, market income and disposable income
Figure 19.1 shows data on three dimensions of inequality (wealth, earnings, and disposable income) in three economies. Recall that wealth is the value of the assets owned by a household (net of their debts). Earnings are income from labour, including from wages, salaries, and self-employment. Market income is the sum of:

all income received as earnings
all income received from business owned by the household or from investments

Finally, disposable income is the income that a family can spend

after paying taxes
after receiving any monetary transfers from the government such as unemployment benefit and pensions













Two things stand out in Figure 19.1:

Wealth is much more unequally distributed than earnings, and earnings are much more unequally distributed than disposable income: Though the differences among the three measures of inequality are much smaller in Japan than in Sweden and the US.
Sweden has much lower disposable income inequality than the other two countries: This is due to its relatively modest inequality in earnings and more importantly, to its system of taxes and transfers which benefits the less well off. It is not due to greater equality in Swedens distribution of wealth. As you can see from the graph, wealth is distributed almost as unequally in Sweden as in the US.

Income inequalities over time and among countries
Another way to measure inequality focuses on the very rich, providing an answer to the question: what fraction of total income or wealth belongs to the richest 1% or 10% of the population? This indicator has the advantage that it can be measured over hundreds of years, because the very rich have long been required to pay taxes, and hence we have reasonably good information on their incomes and wealth. Figure 19.2 shows the fraction of all wealth held by the richest 1%, for all countries on which long-run data is available.4

There appear to be three distinct periods: the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries up to about 1910 show increasing wealth inequality (excepting Norway and Denmark), the twentieth century until 1980 shows decreasing wealth inequality, and the period since shows a modest increase in wealth inequality.
Figure 19.3 presents similar data for the share of income before taxes and transfers (rather than wealth) received by the top 1% of income earners. As in Figure 19.2 there are cross-country differences. For example, in recent years the US is much more unequal than China, India, or the UK. But there are also common trends, similar to the second and third periods in the distribution of wealth: a trend towards less inequality in much of the first three quarters of the twentieth century, followed by an increase in inequality since about 1980.

But this sharp U-turn towards greater inequality did not occur in all countries, including most of the major economies of the continent of Europe. These are shown in Figure 19.4.

Looking at Figures 19.2 to 19.4, one can see that:

There are common trends across most of the countries for which we have data: For example, a fall in inequality between 1920 and 1980.
Countries differ greatly in what happened since 1980: In some of the worlds largest economiesChina, India, and the USinequality rose steeply, while in othersDenmark, France, and the Netherlandsinequality remained close to historically modest levels.

We used data created by Thomas Piketty and his collaborators to create Figures 19.3 and 19.4. He is an economist and author of the bestselling economics book Capital in the Twenty-First Century.5 In our Economist in action video, he examines economic inequality from the French Revolution to today, and explains why careful study of the facts is essential.

Thomas Piketty, Professor of Economics at the Paris School of Economics, explains how he tries to be useful by collecting long-run data on the distribution of wealth.


Inequalities between and within nations
At the beginning of Unit 1 you read that prior to the emergence of capitalism, the income a daughter or a son received depended on where their parents were on the economic ladder. It mattered much less in which part of the world the son or daughter was born.
The economic take-off of the first capitalist economies changed this.
The great divergence in Unit 1 resulted because the kink in the hockey stick for per capita income came early for some countries (Britain, Italy, and Japan in Figure 1.1a), later for others (China and India), and has not yet occurred for others (Nigeria and Argentina) (see also Figure 1.11). The result of the uneven timing of the capitalist revolution around the world was a widening of inequalities among the people of the world, which occurred over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries until very recently. Even the poor in North America and Europe became richer than the rich elsewhere.
How do we measure global inequality? Think about the Lorenz curve constructed by lining up all the individuals in the world from lowest to highest income, irrespective of the country people live in. You know from Figure 1.2 that the poorest 20%the part of the Lorenz curve extending from zero to 0.20 on the horizontal axiswould be very flat: this would represent most of the populations of Liberia and Nigeria, and middle and lower income people in Indonesia and India for example. If we construct the entire Lorenz curve, we can calculate the Gini coefficient for the whole world. This is shown for market income in Figure 19.5. For example, in 2003 the worldwide Gini coefficient was 0.69. We can see that inequality among the worlds individuals is high but has fallen very recently.
The other series in Figure 19.5 (the red line) presents global inequality in a different way. It focuses on the income differences between countries. Imagine that everyone in each country earned the average income for that country. In this thought experiment, everyone in the UK would earn exactly the UKs average income, whereas everyone in China would earn exactly the Chinese average income. What would income inequality look like in this hypothetical example?
The red line shows the result of performing this calculation. In our thought experiment, the only source of inequality in the world would be inequality across countries. Inequality is reduced, but substantial inequalities still exist due to the vast differences in income between countries.

Inequality among the worlds individuals falls (19862013)


The blue line shows income inequality among all individuals in the world. It is, effectively, the worlds Gini coefficient.

The hypothetical inequality between countries falls


The red curve shows the between-country income inequality between 1952 and 2015. To calculate it, we assume everyone in a given country had the same income. Since the 1980s, inequality started to decline rapidly.

 and within-country inequality rises


The decline in between-country inequality accelerated as the growth of the worlds largest poor countries, China and India, took off. But inequality within countries, including China and India, increased.

You can see that the Gini coefficient for all individuals in the world in 1988 (the beginning of the blue line) was 0.69, and this number would have been 0.60 had there been perfect equality within each country (the red line). As a result, we see that 87% of global inequality in income is accounted for by our measure of inequality between countries (that is because 0.60/0.69 = 0.87, or 87%).
The figure also shows that between-country inequality has been falling rapidly: by 2013, 76% of global inequality was between-country inequality (0.47/0.62 = 0.76).
The most recent Gini coefficient for the whole world is 0.62. You know that this is closer to 1 (one person has all the income in the world) than to 0 (no income differences in the world). But how much inequality does this really indicate? To see how to interpret the Gini coefficient, read the Einstein: The Gini Coefficient and worldwide income differences, which is at the end of this section.
Figure 19.5 has three main messages for us:

Most of the inequality in the world is between individuals in different countries (the red series): It is not between individuals in the same country (the difference between the blue and red series).
But this is changing: The worlds two largest and once very poor economiesIndia and Chinaraised their average incomes more rapidly than the richer countries, reducing between-country inequality, and because inequalities across individuals in these countries and many other large nations became greater, increasing within-country inequality.
Inequality between individuals is declining: The net result of these opposite trends is that inequality among the individuals of the world has started to decline.

A glimpse into the future of the rich economies: The missing middle?
The increased inequality that has occurred within many developed countries has been associated with a changing distribution of jobs. Low-paying jobs and high-paying jobs have increased in number while middle-income jobs have become scarcer. The resultmore jobs at the top and the bottom of the economic ladder, and fewer on the middle rungshas been termed the missing middle.
The data in Figure 19.6 illustrate both trends for the US economy. We have used the US economy as an illustration because of the quality of the available data, but similar trends are evident in other high-income countries.
Figure 19.6 arranges jobs from the highest paid (in hourly wages) at the top to the lowest paid jobs at the bottom, and estimates growth or contraction of employment on the horizontal axis.

Notice these things about the data:

The missing middle: Both high-wage and (especially) low-wage occupations are adding many jobs, but employment gains among the occupations with wages in between are more limited.
Jobs replace work once done by family members: The biggest increases are in human services, most of them in health-related professions. These growing occupations substitute for work once done primarily by family members, such as personal care aides and home health care aides.
Machines do routine work: Digitalization reduces the demand for jobs that involve routine tasks, such as postal mail sorters and machine operators. The tasks that machines are not replacing tend to be either well paid (personal financial advisors, nurse practitioners) or poorly paid, such as those taking care of the elderly at home.
High-wage job gainers work with information technologies: Growing occupations with high wages (outside human services) such as operations researchers, statisticians, and web developers are those in which digital information processing has greatly increased the productivity of workers with the right kinds of skills.
Workers with average wages are the losers: Occupations with job losses tend to have near-average wages or less.

Figure 19.6 only showed occupations for which gains or losses are projected to be at least 20% of their 2014 level and change by at least 10,000 employees. But as Figure 19.7 shows, this pattern holds when we look at all jobs in the US economy. The projected trends shown in Figures 19.6 and 19.7 have been underway in the US since at least the 1970s.

Exercise 19.2 Inequalities among your classmates

Using this Gini coefficient calculator, calculate the degree of inequality of height among your classmates.
Why is this Gini coefficient so much smaller than it was for wealth in Figure 19.1?
Now use the calculator to compute the Gini coefficient for another measure (for example, age, weight, commuting time to university, number of siblings, or grade in the last exam).
Explain any differences between this Gini coefficient and that for wealth.



Question 19.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 19.1 shows the inequality in wealth, earnings, and disposable income in the US, Sweden, and Japan using the Gini coefficient.
Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?

Wealth is much more unequally distributed than earnings in all three countries.
Sweden is an unambiguously more unequal society than Japan.
Of the three countries, the US is the most unequal society.
Sweden attains its relatively equal disposable income distribution through its system of taxes and transfers.


In all three countries, the Gini coefficient for wealth is higher than the Gini coefficients for earnings, indicating higher inequality.
Sweden is more unequal than Japan in terms of wealth, but is more equal in terms of disposable income.
This statement is true for earnings and disposable income. However, Sweden is more unequal than the US in terms of wealth.
While the Gini coefficient for Swedens before-tax earnings is similar to that of the US and Japan, the Gini coefficient for disposable income is much lower, indicating that taxes and transfers were effective in redistributing income.



Question 19.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Thomas Pikettys Economist in action video, which of the following were NOT among the reasons that Piketty gave for the fall in the incomes of the very rich during the twentieth century?

the First World War
the Great Depression
the Russian Revolution
the Second World War


Nationalization of assets during the World Wars is one of the reasons Piketty gives.
Economic recession is one of the reasons Piketty gives.
Although political change can affect the distribution of wealth in a country, Piketty does not mention the Russian Revolution in the video.
Nationalization of assets during the World Wars is one of the reasons Piketty gives.



Question 19.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 19.6 is a scatterplot of occupations for the US economy, with the 2015 mean hourly wages on the vertical axis and the 201424 projected job growth on the horizontal axis:
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

Occupations with the biggest projected growth are those that benefit from innovations that increase automation.
Occupations with substantial projected job losses are those with the highest wages, which would encourage employers to invest in automation.
The high wage occupations with projected job growth are either in human services or occupations in which digital information processing has greatly increased the productivity of high skill workers.
There is no particular pattern between the mean average wage and the projected job growth.


Occupations with the biggest projected growth are home health aides and personal care aides. These are services that were once produced almost exclusively in the family but are now being increasingly performed by employees outside the home.
Occupations with substantial projected job losses are those near average wages or less that are already affected by technologies that allow human replacement, such as postal mail service and switchboard operators.
The biggest increases are in human services, most of them in health-related professions. High-wage jobs that involve information technologies are also projected to grow.
Both high- and low-wage occupations are projected to add jobs, while those in between seem to have limited prospects of employment gains.



Einstein The Gini coefficient and worldwide income differences
In Unit 5 you learned that the Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality that is defined as half of the relative mean differences in incomes between all pairs of people in a population.
Recall that the mean difference in incomes among all pairs in the population which we denote as  can be expressed as the income of the richer of the pair (yr) minus the income of the poorer of the pair (yp) summed over all of the pairs in the population, and then divided by the number of pairs in the population (n). The relative mean difference is this quantity divided by mean income, y.
So half of the relative mean difference is:

By rearranging this equation, you can see that the average difference between the two paired people will be the mean income times twice the Gini coefficient:

But there is a more interesting interpretation of the Gini coefficient. If we have drawn all possible pairs from the worlds population, the mean income in the world () will be:

where we defined  and  are the average incomes of the richer and the poorer of each of the pairs, respectively. So we can now rewrite the expression for the Gini coefficient in terms of  and :

By rearranging and dividing through by , we have:

Using this final expression, if the Gini coefficient for the world is 0.62, then:

This says that if the Gini coefficient is 0.62, then across all of the pairs in the population or across a large random sample of the population, the better off of the two is on average 4.26 times richer than the less well off.


Exercise 19.3 Another way to interpret Gini coefficients
Use Figure 5.16 to estimate the Gini coefficient for disposable income in Denmark and South Africa. In explaining the difference in income inequality between these two countries, you could use the information in the Gini as follows: if two people are chosen at random from the population of the country, what is the average ratio of the richer persons income to that of the poorer persons? To allow you to translate data on the Gini coefficient into this ratio, use the formula in the Einstein to construct a table of the richer/poorer ratio for Gini coefficients ranging from 0.0 to 0.9 (in increments of 0.1). Graph your results. Explain the difference in inequality between Denmark and South Africa using your results. What does the formula imply if the Gini coefficient is equal to 1?
