15.12 Another reason for rising inflation at low unemployment
Why is there a trade-off in the economy between unemployment and inflation? So far, the answer is that when unemployment is high in the economy, employees face a high cost of job loss, and employers will be able to get workers to work conscientiously at a lower wage than would be the case when unemployment is lower.

But there is a second reason for the relationship between low unemployment and high inflation. In Figure 15.22, the horizontal axis shows the degree of capacity utilization in the economy. When capacity utilization rises as we move to the right along the horizontal axis, fewer machines are idle, there are fewer empty tables in restaurants, and other indicators (for example, more people working overtime shifts) show a reduction of spare capacity in factories and shops. In Unit 14 we explained the usual response of firms to rising capacity utilization: that they increase investment to expand their ability to meet orders.

capacity-constrainedA situation in which a firm has more orders for its output than it can fill. See also: low capacity utilization.

However, building new plants and installing new equipment takes time. Meanwhile, at current prices, firms have more orders than they can fill. Economists say they are capacity-constrained. They lose nothing by raising prices in these conditions. Moreover, their competitorsfirms producing similar productsare capacity-constrained too, so these firms face less competition, meaning that their demand curves are now steeper (less price-elastic). So all firms will tend to respond to higher capacity utilization by raising the markup of prices above costs, and this will kick off a wage-price spiral.
