3.10 Explaining our working hours: Differences between countries
Figure 3.2 showed that in countries with higher income (GDP per capita) workers tend to have more free time, but also that there are big differences in annual hours of free time between countries with similar income levels. To analyse these differences using our model, we need a different measure of income that corresponds more closely to earnings from employment. The table in Figure 3.22 shows working hours for five countries, together with the disposable income of an average employee (based on the taxes and benefits for a single person without children).
From these figures we have calculated annual free time, and the average wage (by dividing annual income by annual hours worked). Finally, free time per day and daily consumption are calculated by dividing annual free time and earnings by 365.

Figure 3.23 shows how we might use this data, with the model of Section 3.7, to understand the differences between the countries. From the data in Figure 3.22, we have plotted daily consumption and free time for a typical worker in each country, with the corresponding budget constraint constructed as before, using a line through (24, 0) with slope equal to the wage. We have no information about the preferences of workers in each country, and we dont know whether the combinations in the diagram can be interpreted as a choice made by the workers. But, if we assume that they do reflect the workers choices, we can consider what the data tells us about the preferences of workers in different countries.
From Figure 3.23, we see that average free time in Mexico and South Korea were virtually the same, although the wage was much higher in South Korea than in Mexico. South Koreans, Americans and Dutch people have about as much to spend per day, but South Koreans have three hours less of free time. Could it be that South Koreans have the same preferences as Americans, so that if the wage increased in South Korea they would make the same choice? This seems unlikely: the substitution effect would lead them to consume more goods and take less free time, and it is implausible to suppose that the income effect of a wage rise would lead them to consume fewer goods. More plausible is the hypothesis that South Koreans and Americans (on average) have different preferences. Follow the steps in Figure 3.23 to see some hypothetical indifference curves that could explain the differences among countries. Notice that the indifference curves for the US and for South Korea cross. This means that South Koreans and Americans must have different preferences.

Differences between countries


We can use our model and data from Figure 3.22 to understand the differences between the countries. The solid lines show the feasible sets of free time and goods for the five countries in Figure 3.22.

The US and South Korea


Point Q is at the intersection of the indifference curves for the US and South Korea. At this point Americans are willing to give up more units of daily goods for an hour of free time than South Koreans.

Point Q in the last step of the figure is the point of intersection of the two indifference curves shown for South Korea and the US. At that point the US indifference curve is steeper than the South Korean one. This means that the average American is willing to give up more units of daily goods for an hour of free time (this is the MRS) than the average South Korean, which is consistent with the idea that South Koreans work exceptionally hard. So it may be important to take account of differences in preferences among countries, or among individuals.

Exercise 3.10 Preferences and culture
Suppose that the points plotted in Figure 3.23 reflect the choices of free time and consumption made by workers in these five countries according to our model.

Is it possible that people in Turkey and the US have the same preferences? If so, how will a wage rise in Turkey affect consumption and free time? What does this imply about the income and substitution effects?
Suppose that people in Turkey and South Korea have the same preferences. In that case, what can you say about the income and substitution effects of a wage increase?
If wages in South Korea increased, would you expect consumption there to be higher or lower than in the Netherlands? Why?



Exercise 3.11 Working hours across countries and time
The figure below illustrates what has happened to working hours in many countries during the twentieth century (the UK is in both charts to aid comparison).

How would you describe what happened?
How are the countries in Panel A of the figure different from those in Panel B?
What possible explanations can you suggest for why the decline in working hours was greater in some countries than in others?
Why do you think that the decline in working hours is faster in most countries in the first half of the century?
In recent years, is there any country in which working hours have increased? Why do you think this happened?
