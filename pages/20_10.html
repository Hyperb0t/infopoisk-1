20.9 Why is addressing climate change so difficult?
While scientists agree that climate change is occurring and that our economic activity is contributing to it, there are large gaps in scientific understanding of the processes involved and the costs of containing them.
Moreover, as we have seen in Sections 20.3 and 20.4, conflicts of interest over the extent and methods of abatement make it difficult for national governments to adopt broadly supported strategies for mitigating environmental degradation. These conflicts include disagreements about what climate science has shown. In 2015 in the US, 64% of Democratic Party supporters were of the opinion that global warming is both occurring and a result of human activity, but the similar fraction among Republicans was23%.
Also, owners and employees of companies producing or using fossil fuels anticipate income losses as the result of policies to reduce emissions, and spend heavily to influence public opinion on environmental questions. You can read about the impact of this spending in a New York Times article on lead poisoning and examine a list of chemical industry lobbying expenditure for 2015 on OpenSecrets.org.
Lack of adequate information and conflicts of interest are impediments to good public policy in many other areas, but climate change poses two unusual challenges: the problem cannot be solved by national governments acting alone, and those affected by our choices today include generations in the distant future.
International cooperation

tragedy of the commonsA social dilemma in which self-interested individuals acting independently deplete a common resource, lowering the payoffs of all. See also: social dilemma.

Using the tools of game theory in Unit 4, we saw that avoiding the tragedy of the commons that affects the supply of public goods depends on the rules of the game (the institutions). Where there are repeated interactions of the players and there are opportunities to punish those who do not contribute to the public good, the socially optimal outcome can be sustained. The presence of sustainable water-use systems or fish stocks in several continents shows that the tragedy of the commons is avoidable.

dominant strategy equilibriumAn outcome of a game in which every player plays his or her dominant strategy.

In the case of climate change, game theory helps us understand the obstacles to its solution. Recall the way we modelled the climate change game as a prisoners dilemma in which two countries (the US and China) can either restrict carbon emissions or continue with business as usual (see Figure 4.17). Complete self-interest makes the business as usual scenario the dominant strategy equilibrium.
To understand how an international agreement might be negotiated to avoid the business as usual outcome, we introduced inequality aversion and reciprocity. If citizens of the US and China give some weight to the wellbeing of citizens in the other country or experience less wellbeing when inequality rises, and if they are willing to implement costly measures as long as this is also done in the other country, then an outcome where both countries restrict emissions is possible.
Our hypothetical model of climate change negotiations between China and the US gave rise to two Nash equilibria if citizens had both inequality aversion and reciprocity. It is also not completely unrealistic: after intense negotiations following failed talks and a non-binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, all countries committed to eventual emission cuts at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015, with the goal of stabilizing global temperatures at 2C above pre-industrial levels. Virtually all countries also submitted their individual plans for cutting emissions, but these plans are not yet consistent with this temperature stabilization goal.
Unrepresented generations
Our economic activity today will affect climate changes in the distant future, so we are essentially creating consequences that others will bear. This is just an extreme form of external effects that we have studied throughout the course. It is extreme not only in its potential consequences, but also in that those who will suffer the consequences are future generations.
In many countries, public policies have been adopted to address other kinds of environmental external effects, such as local pollution, under pressure from voters bearing the costs of these effects. If you look ahead at Figure 20.25b, you will notice that many of the stars (well above the line) on the Environmental Performance Index are, and have long been, electoral democracies. This is not the case for most of the low performers.
But the future generations that will bear the consequences of our decisions are unrepresented in the policymaking process today. The only way the wellbeing of these unrepresented generations will be taken into account at the environmental bargaining tables around the world is the fact that most people care about, and would like to behave ethically toward, others, as we have seen in Unit 4.
These social preferences underlie the debates among economists about how much we should value the future benefits and costs of the climate change decisions that we make today.
In considering alternative environmental policies, how much we value the wellbeing of future generations is commonly measured by an interest rate, which is literally the rate at which we discount future generations costs or benefits. There are, however, debates about how this discounting process should be done.

When economists disagree The discounting dilemma: How should we account for future costs and benefits?

discounting future generations costs and benefitsA measure of how we currently value the costs and benefits experienced by people who will live in the future. Note that this is not a measure of individual impatience about ones own future benefits and costs.discount rateA measure of the persons impatience: how much the person values an additional unit of consumption now relative to an additional unit of consumption later. It is the slope of the persons indifference curve for consumption now and consumption later, minus one. Also known as: subjective discount rate.

When considering policies, economists seek to compare the benefits and costs of alternative approaches. Doing this presents especially great challenges when the policy problem is climate change. The reason is that the costs will be borne by the present generation but the benefits of a successful abatement policy will be enjoyed by people in the future, many of whom are not yet alive.
Put yourself in the shoes of the impartial policymaker we studied earlier and ask yourself: are there any reasons why, in summing up the benefits and costs of an abatement policy, I should value the benefits expected to be received by future generations any less than the benefits and costs that will be borne by people today? Two reasons come to mind:

Technological progress: The people in the future may have either greater or lesser needs than we do today. For example, as a result of continuing improvements in technology, they may be richer (either in goods or free time) than we are today, so it might seem fair that we should not value the benefits they will receive from our policies as highly as we value the costs that we will bear as a result.
Extinction of the human species: There is a small possibility that future generations will not exist because humanity becomes extinct.


pure impatienceThis is a characteristic of a person who values an additional unit of consumption now over an additional unit later, when the amount of consumption is the same now and later. It arises when a person is impatient to consume more now because she places less value on consumption in the future for reasons of myopia, weakness of will, or for other reasons.

These are good reasons why we might discount the benefits received by future generations. Notice that neither of these reasons for discounting is related to pure impatience.
This was the approach adopted in the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (read the executive summary on the UK National Archives website). Nicholas Stern, an economist, selected a discount rate to take account of the likelihood that people in the future would be richer. Based on an estimate of future productivity increases, Stern discounted the benefits to future generations by 1.3% per annum. To this he added a 0.1% per annum discount rate to account for the risk that in any future year there might no longer be surviving generations. Based on this assessment, Stern advocated policies that would have implemented substantial abatement investments today in order to protect the environment of the future.
Several economists, including William Nordhaus, criticized the Stern Review for its low discount rate. Nordhaus wrote that Sterns choice of discount rate magnifies impacts in the distant future. He concluded that, with a higher discount rate, the Reviews dramatic results disappear.6
Nordhaus advocated the use of a discount rate of 4.3%, which gave vastly different implications. Discounting at this rate means that a $100 benefit occurring 100 years from now is worth $1.48 today, while under Sterns 1.4% rate it would be worth $24.90. This means a policymaker using Nordhaus discount rate would approve of a project that would save future generations $100 in environmental damages only if it cost less than $1.48 today. A policymaker using Sterns 1.4% would approve the project only if it cost less than $24.90.
Not surprisingly, then, Nordhaus recommendations for climate change abatement were far less extensive and less costly than those that Stern proposed. When comparing the use of cap and trade with a carbon tax in Section 20.5, we referred to $40 per tonne as a low-end estimate of the external cost of carbon emissions. This is comparable to the carbon price of $35 per tonne in 2015 proposed by Nordhaus to deter the use of fossil fuels. Stern recommended a price of $360.
Why did the two economists differ by so much? They agreed on the need to discount for the likelihood that future generations would be better off. But Nordhaus had an additional reason to discount future benefits: impatience.
Reasoning as we did in Unit 10 for Julias and Marcos consumption now or later, Nordhaus used estimates based on market interest rates as measures of how people today value future versus present consumption. Using this method, he came up with a discount rate of 3% to measure the way people discount future benefits and costs that they themselves may experience. Nordhaus included this in his discount rate, which is why Nordhaus discount rate (4.3%) is so much higher than Sterns (1.4%).
Critics of Nordhaus pointed out that in evaluating the claims that future generations should have on our concern, a psychological fact like our own impatience is not a reason to discount the needs and aspirations of other people in future generations.
Sterns approach counts all generations as equally worthy of our concern for their wellbeing. Nordhaus, in contrast, takes the current generations point of view and counts future generations as less worthy of our concern than the current generation, much in the way that, for reasons of impatience, we typically value current consumption more highly than our own future consumption.
Is the debate resolved? The discounting question ultimately requires adjudicating between the competing claims of different individuals at different points of time. This involves questions of ethics on which economists will continue to disagree.7


Exercise 20.13 Simulating different discount rates
Download the simple discount rate simulation spreadsheet from our CORE website. The simulator allows you to calculate the present value of receiving $1 in one, 10, 50, and 100 years from now for four discount rates.
In the spreadsheet, the first three discount rates are fixed: zero, Sterns suggestion, and the alternative suggested by Nordhaus.

Explain the effect of different discount rates on the present value of receiving $1 in the future.

The fourth rate is your choice: use the slider in the table to choose a discount rate you think is appropriate for the evaluation of the benefits and costs of climate change policy in the distant future.

Justify your choice. Is it closer to the Nordhaus or Stern proposal? Or is it higher than or lower than both?
Try to find out what discount rate your government (or another government of your choice) uses to evaluate public investment projects. Do you think it is appropriate?

Based on this information, which of the following statements are correct?

The divergence of the discounting effect between different discount rates is larger the longer the time to payment.
Doubling the time to payment leads to halving of the present value.
Doubling the discount rate leads to halving of the present value.
A discount rate of 0% means that payments are worth the same today and at all points in future.


True. Across the full range of discount rates presented, present values remain quite similar when payment is due in one years timefor instance, the gap between the present value at 1% and 5% discounting is only $0.04. When the payment is in 50 years, by contrast, the gap between present value at 1% and 5% discounting has grown to $0.24.
False. For instance, at a 5% discount rate the present value of a $1 payment due in five years is $1  (0.95) = $0.77. The present value of a $1 payment due in ten years is $1  (0.95)10 = $0.60.
False. For instance, at a 1% discount rate, the present value of a $1 payment due in ten years is $1  (0.99)10 = $0.90. At a 2% discount rate, the present value is $1  (0.98)10 = $0.82.
True. A discount rate of 0% implies that you do not discount the future at all, so present values do not decline as the length of time until payment increases.
