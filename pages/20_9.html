20.8 Environmental dynamics
Equilibrium is a fundamental concept of economics. It is essential to the way we predict the prices of goods using the model of supply and demand, or the level of unemployment using the model of the labour market. But for practical purposes we need to know more than simply the equilibrium of a model. In Units 16 and 18, for example, you learned that it may take a very long time for the labour market to move from one equilibrium to another, so what happens along the way is important.
And as the examples of the Grand Banks fisheries collapse or the threats to the Amazon rainforest described at the beginning of the unit showed, there may be more than one equilibrium. A healthy sustainable environment could be an equilibriumthink of Grand Banks cod fishing in the 100 years prior to 1950. And another could be the same geographical location devoid of cod, an example of environmental collapse. We sometimes refer to the process of getting to the second equilibrium as a vicious cycle, and environmental sustainability as a virtuous cycle.

disequilibrium processAn economic variable may change either because the things that determine the equilibrium value of that variable have changed (an equilibrium process), or because the system is not in equilibrium so that there exist forces for change that are internal to the model in question (a disequilibrium process). The latter process applies when the economy moves towards a stable equilibrium or away from a tipping point (an unstable equilibrium).

The passage from one of these equilibria to anothercalled a disequilibrium processcan be rapid, because it is propelled by positive feedback processes, which you studied in Unit 17 in the case of housing markets. Just as in the case of a house price bubble, the reduction in fish stocks in the Grand Banks became self-reinforcing.
Here we study these disequilibrium processes. We explain why, when they are present and when we lack important pieces of information about what kinds of human actions will set off a collapse, we need a different approach to policymaking, one that stresses the need to avoid a cataclysmic environmental collapse.
The dynamics of the biosphere
Long before human economic and other activity began to have a substantial effect, the natural environment was constantly changing as a result of the chemical and physical processes that make up the biosphere.
Over tens of thousands of years, an ice age would give way to a period of warming in which glaciers and sea ice covers retreated towards the poles, to be followed by a new period of cold temperatures with the advance of the ice sheets into what are now temperate climates. On shorter time scales, clouds of dust sent up by massive volcanic eruptions blocked out the sun, as occurred during the little ice age 500 years ago (you can see the drop in average temperature around the middle of the fifteenth century in Figure1.6b).
Climate today is heavily influenced by human economic activity, but it is a process with its own dynamics of change. A challenge to environmental policymaking is that some natural processes themselves set in motion positive feedback processes so that small initial changes can lead to much larger effects, resulting in faster and greater deterioration than anticipated.

tipping pointAn unstable equilibrium at the boundary between two regions characterized by distinct movements in some variable. If the variable takes a value on one side, the variable moves in one direction; on the other, it moves in the other direction. See also: asset price bubble.prudential policyA policy that places a very high value on reducing the likelihood of a disastrous outcome, even if this is costly in terms of other objectives foregone. Such an approach is often advocated where there is great uncertainty about the conditions under which a disastrous outcome would occur.

Like the Grand Banks fisheries and the Amazon rainforest, many freshwater systems, such as lakes and rivers, are subject to similar vicious circles of deterioration and collapse.
Where positive feedbacks are important there may be some level of environmental deterioration called a tipping point, which if passed, sets in motion a process leading to abrupt and hard-to-reverse destruction of an environmental resource. When this is the case, environmental policy must go beyond balancing the costs and benefits of the abatement of environmental damage. Instead, policymakers must devise measures to ensure that a tipping pointespecially if it is uncertainfor a critical resource is not passed. In this context, a prudential policy would seek to avoid the risk that the given situation may itself be radically and irreversibly degraded.
Environmental equilibria
To understand the idea of planetary boundaries and environmental collapse, we will use the example of Arctic sea ice. This is an example of an environmental system that may have already passed a tipping point due to global climate change. Figure 20.22 shows that for the past 50 years, the extent of the sea ice at the end of summer has been declining at an increasing rate. The insert in the figure illustrates the change in the last few decades.

First, consider the vicious cycle. Open sea surface area is darker than ice so more open sea surface area leads the earths surface to reflect less radiation. It therefore absorbs more radiation and warms up. The resulting higher winter and spring surface temperatures in turn cause less ice in the summer. The virtuous cycle is just the opposite: when there is extensive summer ice, the radiation is reflected rather than absorbed and the temperatures stay low, maintaining the ice which reflects the radiation, keeping temperatures low, and so on.
Extensive summer sea ice and no summer sea ice are the stable equilibria of the Arctic sea ice ecology. Each of these states is reinforced by the positive feedback loop shown in Figure 20.23. You may want to compare this positive feedback process to the one causing housing price bubbles and busts discussed in Unit 17.

Environmental tipping point

On one side of an environmental tipping point, processes of environmental degradation are self-limiting.
On the other side, positive feedbacks lead to self-reinforcing, runaway environmental degradation.


What happens in between these two stable equilibria? We analyse this using the model introduced in Unit 17 for the housing market. You will note the similarity between Figure 20.23 and Figure 17.18 of boom and bust in a housing market. But now, instead of the house price this year and next on the axes, the horizontal axis is the extent of sea ice today (called Et to refer to the environment this year). The vertical axis is sea ice next year. This figure shows how the extent of sea ice today maps to the extent of sea ice tomorrow.
The 45-degree line depicts an unchanging environment, since along that line any value of sea ice this period on the horizontal axis is the same next period (on the vertical axis). The S-shaped line is the environmental dynamics curve or EDC for short. Just as in Unit 17, points at which the EDC crosses the 45-degree line are equilibria. This is because the amount of sea ice this year is the same as next year (remember an equilibrium is something stationary, that is, unchanging from year to year). Two of the equilibria are stable: each equilibrium is stabilized by self-reinforcing feedback processes shown in the upper panel. You can refer back to Figures 11.18 and 11.19 for the adjustment processes around a stable and an unstable equilibrium. Point A is the unstable equilibrium or tipping point. Any slight change in sea ice at the unstable equilibrium leads in the direction of either B or C.
At any point in between the two stable equilibria at B and C, from year to year the sea ice cover will either be increasing towards the virtuous equilibrium at B or disappearing towards the no-sea-ice equilibrium at C. For example, beginning with a sea ice extent of E0, the EDC shows the (higher) level the following year and the arrow indicates the adjustment to the equilibrium at point B.
This occurs as follows: from an initial level of E0 with a cold climate and Arctic summer ice, the sea ice next year would be more than this year as shown, since the EDC is above the 45-degree line. When there is a lot of ice, the feedback in the direction of maintaining the ice cover is strong, and we tend to stay there even when variations in temperatures (due to seasons or decadal variation in ocean currents) cause temporary warming and temporary reductions in sea ice. The extent of the ice means that the system rebounds towards the high equilibrium.
Planetary boundaries
As we have seen, the two stable equilibria are separated by an unstable equilibrium at A. So a reduction in sea ice below the tipping point will be amplified, rather than dampened. At that point, the feedback becomes stronger in the direction of reducing the ice cover and bringing the system to the no-Arctic-summer-ice state. The capacity of the system to recover would have been pushed beyond its limits.
What is the role of climate change in all that? We shall see that to analyse this we need to explain why the S-shaped environmental dynamics curve can shift down. If it shifts, the system will not stabilize around the high-summer-ice equilibrium at B.
A warming climate does two things, one of which is gradual, the other cataclysmic. First, starting from the high equilibrium, a warming climate brings the system closer to a tipping point, illustrated by a downward shift in the S-shaped curve. Second, it may change the system such that at some point, the equilibrium with extensive summer sea ice disappears.
To understand these effects, take a look at Figure 20.24. A warmer climate means that for any amount of sea ice this year, the amount that will be there next year is less. This is not a movement along the EDC but instead a downward shift of the whole curve. As a result, less ice forms in the winter and the whole system is more vulnerable to the increase in temperature and open surface area in the summer.

Initial high stable equilibrium


The environment starts at equilibrium point B.














Global warming lowers the EDC curve


A warmer climate means that for any amount of sea ice this year, the amount that will be there next year is less. The whole curve shifts downward.














System collapse to ice-free summers


Beyond a certain amount of winter warming, the EDC shifts down so much that there is no longer a high stable equilibrium. The last tipping point, Z, disappears and the system is permanently locked in the no-sea-ice stable state at K.




In Figure 20.24, the shift down in the EDC has moved the high equilibrium downwards, so there will be less sea ice from year to year. Notice too that the warmer climate has also shifted the tipping point upwards to Z from its initial position at A, which widens the danger zone of environmental collapse.
Is this what has been happening over the last century? From Figure 20.22, it appears that until the late 1960s, the Arctic sea ice was approaching a high equilibrium (like B). Thereafter, the extent of sea ice declined at first gradually, illustrated in Figure 20.24 by the movement from B downwards towards Z. But then Figure 20.22 shows that from the mid-1980s, the reduction in sea ice was much more rapid, as would occur if the last tipping point had been passed and the system was in freefall towards no summer sea ice at all (point K).
Combining the model and the available evidence, the change from the Arctic with extensive summer ice to the Arctic with no-summer-ice equilibria appears to be underway. Scientists are unsure how reversible this loss of the Arctic summer ice is even if we reverse global warming. We may have crossed a point of no return. The lack of Arctic sea iceif that is what is in storewill add to the already powerful forces creating a warmer climate.
The sea ice might be restored eventually by a new ice age of sharply colder climate. Given the pattern of climate change over the past 800,000 years, this might be expected 50,000 years from now.
Prudential policies to address tipping points
The aim of policies to slow global warming would be to keep the EDC within the set of feasible environmental equilibria shown by the green dashed line between B and Z. In the presence of tipping points, prudential policies should reduce the risk that a tipping point will be crossed.
The need to be prudent arises not just because there is a tipping point but also because of the uncertainty about how close we are to the last tipping point. Prudent policy means seeking to avoid cataclysmic risks even if their likelihood is extremely small. The closer we are to a tipping point, the higher the chance of unknowingly crossing it and finding it impossible to reverse the degradation and avoid a catastrophic outcome.

biodiversity loss (rate of)Proportion of species that become extinct every year.

Planetary boundaries are defined for critical environmental variables (such as temperature and biodiversity loss), and give levels of these variables that scientists think will keep us sufficiently far away from problematic tipping points to be within a safe operating space. Respecting planetary boundaries is a prudential policy.
The value of prudence has implications for which kinds of policies are most appropriate. To see this, suppose there is no uncertainty about either:

The state of the environment: How close to a tipping point the ecosystem was, for example.
The effect of tax incentives: What will the effect be on carbon emissions?

Given this level of certainty, a tax on carbon emissions or a cap and trade policy could obtain the same outcome. Cap and trade would impose the desired level of abatement and the carbon tax would set the right price for carbon emissions, also leading to the desired level of abatement. In both cases, the policymaker must decide on the desired level of abatement before selecting the most appropriate policy.
However, we are often highly uncertain about both the state of the environment and the effectiveness of tax or subsidy policies. In these cases, cap and trade is more prudent because it can guarantee a particular level of emissions (the cap), which can be set sufficiently far away from the possible thresholds.

Exercise 20.11 Representing regime shifts
The Regime Shifts DataBase documents different types of regime shifts (another word for tipping point) that we have evidence for in human-dominated ecological systems. Choose one from the database and describe the situation in your own words, including the types of equilibria and their characteristics, and how the system transitions from one equilibrium to another. Draw a diagram similar to Figure 20.23 to represent it, and explain the feedback loops that are involved.


Exercise 20.12 Self-reinforcing processes
Self-reinforcing processes, such as the ones described above, do not happen only in nature. In Unit 17, for example, we discussed how increases in house prices can reinforce a boom and become self-sustaining, leading to a housing price bubble.
Explain the ways in which the cumulative self-reinforcing processes described by environmental scientists are similar to (or different from) processes that occur in a housing or stock price bubble.
