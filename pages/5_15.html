5.14 Conclusion
Economic interactions are governed by institutions, which specify the rules of the game. To understand the possible outcomes, we first consider what allocations are technically feasible, given the limits imposed by biology and technology. Then, if participation is voluntary, we look for economically feasible allocations: those which could provide mutual gains (a surplus), and therefore are Pareto-improving relative to the reservation positions of the parties involved.
Which feasible allocation will arise depends on the bargaining power of each party, which determines how a surplus will be shared and in turn depends on the institutions governing the interaction. We can evaluate and compare allocations using two important criteria for judging economic interactions: fairness and Pareto efficiency.
