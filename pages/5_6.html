5.5 Technically feasible allocations
Initially Angela could consume (or sell) everything she produced. Now Bruno has arrived, and he has a gun. He has the power to implement any allocation that he chooses. He is even more powerful than the dictator in the dictator game (in which a Proposer dictates how a pie is to be divided). Why? Bruno can determine the size of the pie, as well as how it is shared.
Unlike the experimental subjects in Unit 4, in this model Bruno and Angela are entirely self-interested. Bruno wants only to maximize the amount of grain he can get. Angela cares only about her own free time and grain (as described by her indifference curves).
We now make another important assumption. If Angela does not work the land, Bruno gets nothing (there are no other prospective farmers that he can exploit). What this means is that Brunos reservation option (what he gets if Angela does not work for him) is zero. As a result, Bruno thinks about the future: he will not take so much grain that Angela will die. The allocation must keep her alive.

technically feasibleAn allocation within the limits set by technology and biology.

First, we will work out the set of technically feasible combinations of Angelas hours of work and the amount of grain she receives: that is, all the combinations that are possible within the limitations of the technology (the production function) and biology (Angela must have enough nutrition to do the work and survive).

biologically feasibleAn allocation that is capable of sustaining the survival of those involved is biologically feasible.

Figure 5.4 shows how to find the technically feasible set. We already know that the production function determines the feasible frontier. This is the technological limit on the total amount consumed by Bruno and Angela, which in turn depends on the hours that Angela works. Angelas biological survival constraint shows the minimum amount of grain that she needs for each amount of work that she does; points below this line would leave her so undernourished or overworked that she would not survive. This constraint shows what is biologically feasible. Notice that if she expends more energy working, she needs more food; thats why the curve rises from right to left from point Z as her hours of work increase. The slope of the biological survival constraint is the marginal rate of substitution between free time and grain in securing Angelas survival.

The fact that Angelas survival might be in jeopardy is not a hypothetical example. During the Industrial Revolution, life expectancy at birth in Liverpool, UK, fell to 25 years: slightly more than half of what it is today in the poorest countries in the world. In many parts of the world today, farmers and workers capacity to do their jobs is limited by their caloric intake.

Technically feasible allocations.
        















The biological survival constraint


If Angela does not work at all, she needs 2.5 bushels to survive (point Z). Ifshe gives up some free time and expends energy working, she needs more food, so the curve is higher when she has less free time. This is the biological survival constraint.














Biologically infeasible and technically infeasible points


Points below the biological survival constraint are biologically infeasible, while points above the feasible frontier are technically infeasible.














Angelas maximum working day


Given the feasible frontier, there is a maximum amount of work above which Angela could not survive, even if she could consume everything she produced.














The technically feasible set


The technically feasible allocations are the points in the lens-shaped area bounded by the feasible frontier and the biological survival constraint (including points on the frontier).




Note that there is a maximum amount of work that would allow her barely to survive (because of the calories she burns up working). As we saw in Unit 2, throughout human history people crossed the survival threshold when the population outran the food supply. This is the logic of the Malthusian population trap. The productivity of labour placed a limit on how large the population could be.

Exercise 5.5 Changing conditions for production
Using Figure 5.4, explain how you would represent the effects of each of the following:

an improvement in growing conditions such as more adequate rainfall
Angela having access to half the land that she had previously
the availability to Angela of a better designed hoe making it physically easier to do the work of farming.


In Angelas case, it is not only the limited productivity of her labour that might jeopardize her survival, but also how much of what she produces is taken by Bruno. If Angela could consume everything she produced (the height of the feasible frontier) and choose her hours of work, her survival would not be in jeopardy since the biological survival constraint is below the feasible frontier for a wide range of working hours. The question of biological feasibility arises because of Brunos claims on her output.
In Figure 5.4, the boundaries of the feasible solutions to the allocation problem are formed by the feasible frontier and the biological survival constraint. This lens-shaped shaded area gives the technically possible outcomes. We can now ask what will actually happenwhich allocation will occur, and how does this depend on the institutions governing Brunos and Angelas interaction?

Question 5.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.4 shows Angela and Brunos feasible frontier, and Angelas biological survival constraint.
Based on this figure, which of the following is correct?

If Angela works 24 hours she can survive.
There is a technically feasible allocation in which Angela does not work.
A new technology that boosted grain production would result in a bigger technically feasible set.
If Angela did not need so much grain to survive the technically feasible set would be smaller.


At 24 hours of work (or 0 hours of free time), Angelas biological survival constraint is above the feasible frontier. This means that at this point she cannot produce enough grain to survive.
Angela would not produce any grain if she did not work. This is not technically feasible because she needs 2.5 bushels of grain to survive.
Technology that boosted grain production would increase the amount of grain that could be produced for any given number of working hours, shifting the feasible frontier up and thus expanding the technically feasible set.
If Angela did not need as much grain to survive, the biological survival constraint would be lower, making the technically feasible set bigger.
