18.3 Globalization and migration
In the late nineteenth century, declining transport costs and rising wages made passage to America affordable for millions. Since then, labour migration is probably the dimension of globalization along which international economic integration has advanced the least. Indeed, labour into and out of some countries is less mobile internationally today than it was in 1913. Figure 18.11 plots immigration into the US as a percentage of the increase in the US population. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century immigrants accounted for more than half of the increase in the US population, their numbers more than equalling the number of births minus the number of deaths. Restrictive legislation curbed immigration between the world wars. Although the contribution of immigrants to the growth in population has been rising again since the Second World War, it has not matched the growth before 1914. The low figures from the mid-1940s to the 1970s can in part also be explained by the relatively high birth rate in the US over this period.

There were relatively few institutional barriers to immigration in the late nineteenth century. Today, migrants without appropriate documentation may be deported or imprisoned. This meant that when Europe was experiencing its population boom, as death rates fell sharply and birth rates fell only with a lag, it was able to ship its surplus population to what the fifteenth-century explorer Amerigo Vespucci had named the New World in America. Todays lower-income countries are not so fortunate. Immigration barriers were already in place during the late nineteenth century, but they became much stricter during and after the First World War, and rich countries retain strict immigration barriers to this day.
Thus the movement of goods and finance between countries is easier, and greater in magnitude, than the movement of people. Sending your money or your goods to some distant economy is much easier than sending yourself. You might have to learn an entirely new language or culture, not to mention leaving behind family and your home community. This is one reason why, for labour, there is nothing equivalent to the reduction in price gaps for goods that we discussed above. There is no tendency of wages in different countries around the world to become more similar.
Figure 18.12 shows the trends in wages paid to manufacturing workers expressed as a ratio of the wages of US manufacturing workers. It indicates, for example, that in the late 1970s, workers in France were paid 80% of the wage of US workers but, by 2012, they were paid more than 15% more.

There are three developments that we can see in Figure 18.12:

Like France, many other European countries caught up with the US in manufacturing wages, in some cases surpassing them by more than 40% (Norway and Sweden).
Wages in South Korea and Japan rapidly converged towards the US wage level.
A number of low-wage countries (for example, Sri Lanka) remained far behind, some falling even further behind (Mexico).

In conclusion, there was a dramatic increase in the integration of the world economy during the nineteenth century, which was marked by increasing volumes of trade and corresponding reduction in price gaps, as well as the movement of capital. This was followed by a brief period of deglobalization during the Great Depression and the Second World War, and renewed globalization afterwards, especially since the 1990s. These three waves of globalization, deglobalization, and reglobalization are equivalent to those in Figure 18.4.
Trade costs and barriers to the mobility of capital and labour fell in the nineteenth century, largely as a result of steam-driven transportation technologies. They rose again in the interwar period, largely due to government interventiontaxes and other barriers to trade, capital controls and immigration restrictionsand fell again in the late twentieth century, as a result of more liberal policies and technological change. National boundaries, however, have continued to be important barriers to the global integration of labour markets.

Question 18.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.11 depicts the level of immigration into the US as a percentage of the change in the US population.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

In the decade prior to the First World War, the number of immigrants was higher than the number of births minus the number of deaths.
Wars cause permanent declines in the level of migration.
As with trade in goods and capital flows, there is evidence of a continued trend of reglobalization in migration since the end of the Second World War.
The trend in the graph suggests that with high migration over the past 150 years the wages in different countries around the world should now be similar.


Since immigration accounted for over half the increase in US population, the number of new immigrants must have exceeded the difference between births and deaths.
There was a sharp rise in the immigration level for a short period after the First World War. Even if this were not the case, remember that we must be cautious before inferring causality from a time series graph such as thismany other factors influence the level of migration.
Since the restrictive immigration law in 1923, the level of immigration has not recovered to the levels seen before it, suggesting that national boundaries continue to be barriers to the global integration of labour markets.
With restricted migration, this is not true. Whilst wages in the manufacturing sector in many European countries, as well as Japan, have converged (and in many cases overtaken) the level in the US since 1975, wages in Mexico have actually fallen relative to the US.
