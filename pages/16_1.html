How long-term trends and differences in living standards and unemployment between countries are the result of technological progress, institutions, and policies

The increasing use of machinery and other capital goods in production, along with technological progress made possible by increasing knowledge, have been the foundation for rising living standards in the long run.
The creative destruction of older ways of producing goods and organizing production has led to continuous job loss as well as job creation, but not higher unemployment in the long run.
A countrys economic institutions and policies can be evaluated by their capacity to keep involuntary unemployment low and to sustain increases in real wages.
Many successful economies have provided extensive forms of co-insurance against the job losses arising from both creative destruction and competition from other economies, so that most citizens of these nations welcome both technological change and the global exchange of goods and services.
The main difference between high-performing economies and laggards is that the institutions and policies of high performers incentivize their main actors to increase the size of the pie, rather than fighting over the size of their slice.

In 1412, the city council of Cologne prohibited the production of a spinning wheel by a local craftsman because it feared unemployment among textile manufacturers that used the hand spindle. In the sixteenth century, new ribbon-weaving machines were banned in large parts of Europe. In 1811, in the early stage of the Industrial Revolution in England, the Luddite movement protested forcefully against new labour-saving machinery, such as spinning machines that allowed one worker to produce the amount of yarn previously produced by 200 workers. The movement was led by a young unskilled artisan, Ned Ludd, who allegedly destroyed the spinning machines.1
The Swiss economist Jean-Charles-Lonard de Sismondi (17731842) contemplated a new world where the King sits alone on his island, endlessly turning cranks to produce, with automatons, all that England now manufactures. The increasing use of information technology has caused contemporary economists, including Jeremy Rifkin, to voice the same fears.2
Sismondi and Rifkin made plausible arguments. But as we saw in Unit 1, as a result of labour-saving innovations, many countries moved to the upward part of the hockey stick and experienced sustained growth in living standards. Workers were paid moreremember the real wage hockey stick from Unit 2 (Figure 2.1). The end of work also hasnt happened yet, though in 1932 Bertrand Russell, a philosopher, expressed anticipation rather than fear of the end of work, arguing that: [T]here is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached.
Technological progress has not created rising unemployment rates. Instead it has raised the lowest wage that firms can pay while still covering their costs. As a result, technological progress expands the resources the firm has to invest in increasing production, and it also incentivizes continued investment. By focusing only on the destruction of jobs, those who worry about the end of work have ignored the fact that labour-saving technological progress also induces the investment that helps to create jobs.
In most economies for which data is available, at least 10% of jobs are destroyed every year, and about the same number of new ones are created. In France or the UK, every 14 seconds a job is destroyed and another one created. This is part of the creative destruction process at the heart of capitalist economies that we described in Units 1 and 2.
Those who lose their jobs bear substantial costs in the short run. The short run may not seem very short to them: it can last years or even decades. Those who benefit may be the children of the handloom weaver displaced by the power loom, or the children of the unemployed typist who was displaced by the computer. They benefit by finding a job in an occupation that is more productive than the job their parents did, and they may share in the benefit from the new goods and services that are available because the power loom or the computer exist.
The destructive part of creative destruction affects occupations that may often be concentrated in particular regions, with large losses in wages and jobs. Families and communities who are the losers often take generations to recover. Like short run, the term average often hides the costs to the workers displaced and communities destroyed by the introduction of new technologies.
Today, for example, information and communication technology (ICT) is reshaping our societies. ICT is replacing much of routine labour, in many cases further impoverishing the already poor. People who would have previously anticipated rising living standards have fewer job opportunities.
Nevertheless, most people benefit from the fall in prices due to the new technology. For better or worse, creative destruction as a result of technological progress is part of the dynamism of the capitalist economic system. And while lives have been disrupted and the environment increasingly threatened by this dynamism, the introduction of improved technologies is also the key to rising living standards in the long run. We shall see that:

technological change is constantly putting people out of work
but the countries that have avoided high levels of unemployment are among those in which the productivity of labour has increased the most

Figure 16.1 shows unemployment rates for 16 OECD countries from 1960 to 2014.

Data from 19602004: David R Howell, Dean Baker, Andrew Glyn, and John Schmitt. 2007. Are Protective Labor Market Institutions at the Root of Unemployment? A Critical Review of the Evidence.Capitalism and Society 2(1) (January). Data from 2005 to 2012: OECD. 2015.OECD Statistics.



Unemployment rates were low and quite similar in the 1960s, and then diverged in the 1970s, reflecting in part the different responses to the oil shocks described in Unit 14. Of these countries, only Japan (JPN), Austria (AUT), and Norway (NOR) had unemployment rates that stayed below 6% over the entire period. In Spain (SPA), unemployment was around 20% from the mid 1980s to the end of the 1990s. It then halved in the 2000s before jumping back above 20% following the financial crisis and Eurozone crisis from 2009. In this respect Germany (GER) is unusual: unemployment fell in the years following the global financial crisis.
While there has been no upward trend in unemployment rates over the long run, there have been two important developments in the labour market that have accompanied the growth in living standards. As we saw in Unit 3 (Figure 3.1), average annual hours worked by people with jobs have fallen. In addition, a larger fraction of adults are working for pay, which is mainly due to the rise in the proportion of women who do paid work.
The patterns of unemployment in Figure 16.1 are not explained by national differences in the rate of innovation, or waves of innovation over time. They reflect differences in the institutions and policies in force in the countries.
As production has become more capital-intensive, how have living standards improved over the long run without producing mass unemployment? We begin by studying the accumulation of capital (the increasing stock of machinery and equipment) and infrastructure (such as roads and ports), which have always been fundamental to the dynamism of capitalism.

Exercise 16.1 Wealth and life satisfaction
As we saw in Unit 3, technological progress increases your hourly productivity. This means that by working the same number of hours you could thus produce and consume more, or you can produce and consume the same amount of goods while working fewer hours and enjoying more free time.
The economist Olivier Blanchard argues that the difference in output per capita between the US and France is partially due to the fact that relative to those in the US, the French have used some of the increase in productivity to enjoy more free time rather than raise consumption.

Think about two countries, one that has lower GDP per capita due to fewer hours worked, and another that has higher GDP per capita due to more hours worked (such as France and the US). Assuming that overall life satisfaction consists only of free time and consumption, in which country would you expect overall life satisfaction to be higher, and why? Clearly state any assumptions you make about the preferences of residents in each country.
Considering only working hours and GDP per capita, which country (France or the US) would you prefer to live in, and why?  How would your answer change if you considered other factors as well?



Question 16.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 16.1 is a graph of unemployment rates for 16 OECD countries from 1960 to 2014.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

There is no correlation between unemployment rates across countries.
There has been a clear upward trend in unemployment in all countries in the last 30 years.
The unemployment rates of different countries were affected very differently by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
The unemployment rate rose in all countries following the 2008 global financial crisis.


Most countries had lower unemployment rates in the 1960s than in the 1980s and 1990s, and most saw some decline in the late 1990s, suggesting a mild positive correlation.
The graphs show no clear upward trend in unemployment since the 1980s.
While most countries had higher unemployment after the oil shocks than before, some saw very large increases, like Ireland and Spain, while others saw small increases, like Japan, Austria, and Norway.
The unemployment rate actually fell in Germany after 2008.
