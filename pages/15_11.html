15.10 Demand shocks and demand-side policies
To see how policymakers respond to demand shocks in practice, think about the recession in the US after the bursting of the tech bubble. The table in Figure 15.17 illustrates the fiscal and monetary policy mix used during the US recession in 2001 when after a decade of expansion, the growth rate of the US economy slowed.
The top row shows that the annual growth rate of real GDP decreased from 4.1% to 0.9%. The bottom two rows in Figure 15.17 show that the slowdown led to rising unemployment and falling inflation, exactly as we would expect from a negative demand shock. The end of the boom of the late 1990s, during which firms had been over-optimistic about the profits to be made on investment in new technology and had overestimated the need for new capacity in ICT-producing industries, triggered the slowdown (see Unit 11 for more about the tech bubble and Figure 14.5 for the model of investment with supply and demand effects shifting the investment function).

The recession and the policy response
The figure shows that the contribution of non-residential investment to the percentage change in GDP was much larger than either residential investment or government expenditure in 2000. It fell in 2001, pulling the economy into recession.
The recession could have been much worse in the absence of the strong response from monetary and fiscal policy.
In 2001, the Federal Reserve started rapidly decreasing the nominal interest rate, from a high of 6.2% on average in 2000, to 3.9% in 2001, and a low of 1.1% in 2003.

Monetary policy: We can see from Figure 15.17 that this large drop in nominal interest rates helped boost residential investment in 2001 and 2002. Its contribution to growth became much larger than before. It also helped non-residential investment to recover, but the adjustment was slower: the contribution of non-residential investment to growth became positive only in 2003.
Fiscal policy: To compensate for the stagnation in firms private investment, the government used expansionary fiscal policy. It introduced large tax cuts and increased spending in 2001 and 2002. The multiplier model helps explain the logic of the governments policy, and the large increase in the contribution of public expenditure to growth in 2001 and 2002.6

We can see from Figure 15.17 that the swift action of the government and central bank helped to stabilize the economy. Inflation and GDP growth bounced back rapidly from the recession. Unemployment was slower to react, however, continuing to creep up in 2003. In fact, the US unemployment rate did not drop all the way down to its 2000 level, perhaps suggesting that the US economy was operating above capacity in the run-up to the tech bubble.
The recession and the model
We can apply the model we have developed to the case of a slump in investment spending in the US economy in Figure 15.18. From the multiplier diagram in the lower panel, we know that a fall in investment spending shifts the aggregate demand line down, and leads to a new goods market equilibrium in the economy with lower output and higher unemployment. Figure 15.17 showed that this is what happened in the US after the tech bubble ended. Unemployment increased from 4% in 2000 to 6% in 2003, and inflation fell from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002.
Following the logic of the Phillips curve, inflation will fall in response to a rise in unemployment. Work through the steps of the analysis in Figure 15.18 to see the consequences of the shock, and the governments response of a fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserves response of looser monetary policy.
Note that now, the best outcome for the policymaker is not full employment. Rather, it is the level of employment (and unemployment) that maintains labour market equilibrium, to avoid consistently rising or falling inflation. In Figure 15.18, point X is the policymakers best outcome. Inflation is at target and employment is consistent with constant inflation. It is clear from the indifference curves that the recession reduces wellbeing in the economy.

Before the downturn


The economy is at point C.














The investment slump


This shifts aggregate demand down. The economy moves to a situation with higher unemployment and lower inflation (from point C to point D).














Both the central bank and the government respond


A cut in the interest rate and fiscal stimulus via tax cuts and increased government spending shifts the aggregate demand line back to its starting position.














The effect of intervention


The increase in output from higher aggregate spending reduces unemployment and raises inflation. The economy moves back along the Phillips curve to point C.
