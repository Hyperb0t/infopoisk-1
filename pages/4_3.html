4.2 Equilibrium in the invisible hand game

best responseIn game theory, the strategy that will give a player the highest payoff, given the strategies that the other players select.

Game theory describes social interactions, but it may also provide predictions about what will happen. To predict the outcome of a game, we need another concept: best response. This is the strategy that will give a player the highest payoff, given the strategies the other players select.
In Figure 4.2b we represent the payoffs for Anil and Bala in the invisible hand game using a standard format called a payoff matrix. A matrix is just any rectangular (in this case square) array of numbers. The first number in each box is the reward received by the row player (whose name begins with A as a reminder that his payoff is first). The second number is the column players payoff.
Think about best responses in this game. Suppose you are Anil, and you consider the hypothetical case in which Bala has chosen to grow rice. Which response yields you the higher payoff? You would grow cassava (in this case, youAnilwould get a payoff of 4, but you would get a payoff of only 1 if you grew rice instead).

dominant strategyAction that yields the highest payoff for a player, no matter what the other players do.

Work through the steps in Figure 4.2b to see that choosing Cassava is also Anils best response if Bala chooses Cassava. So Cassava is Anils dominant strategy: it will give him the highest payoff, whatever Bala does. And you will see that in this game Bala also has a dominant strategy. The analysis also gives you a handy method for keeping track of best responses by placing dots and circles in the payoff matrix.

Finding best responses


Begin with the row player (Anil) and ask: What would be his best response to the column players (Balas) decision to play Rice?














Anils best response if Bala grows rice


If Bala chooses Rice, Anils best response is to choose Cassavathat gives him 4, rather than 1. Place a dot in the bottom left-hand cell. A dot in a cell means that this is the row players best response.














Anils best response if Bala grows cassava


If Bala chooses Cassava, Anils best response is to choose Cassava toogiving him 3, rather than 2. Place a dot in the bottom right-hand cell.














Anil has a dominant strategy


Both dots are on the bottom row. Whatever Balas choice, Anils best response is to choose Cassava. Cassava is a dominant strategy for Anil.














Now find the column players best responses


If Anil chooses Rice, Balas best response is to choose Rice (3 rather than 2). Circles represent the column players best responses. Place a circle in the upper left-hand cell.














Bala has a dominant strategy too


If Anil chooses Cassava, Balas best response is again to choose Rice (he gets 4 rather than 3). Place a circle in the lower left-hand cell. Rice is Balas dominant strategy (both circles are in the same column).














Both players will play their dominant strategies


We predict that Anil will choose Cassava and Bala will choose Rice because that is their dominant strategy. Where the dot and circle coincide, the players are both playing best responses to each other.




Because both players have a dominant strategy, we have a simple prediction about what each will do: play their dominant strategy. Anil will grow cassava, and Bala will grow rice.

dominant strategy equilibriumAn outcome of a game in which every player plays his or her dominant strategy.

This pair of strategies is a dominant strategy equilibrium of the game.
Remember from Unit 2 that an equilibrium is a self-perpetuating situation. Something of interest does not change. In this case, Anil choosing Cassava and Bala choosing Rice is an equilibrium because neither of them would want to change their decision after seeing what the other player chose.
If we find that both players in a two-player game have dominant strategies, the game has a dominant strategy equilibrium. As we will see later, this does not always happen. But when it does, we predict that these are the strategies that will be played.
Because both Anil and Bala have a dominant strategy, their choice of crop is not affected by what they expect the other person to do. This is similar to the models in Unit 3 in which Alexeis choice of hours of study, or Angelas working hours, did not depend on what others did. But here, even though the decision does not depend on what the others do, the payoff does. For example, if Anil is playing his dominant strategy (Cassava) he is better off if Bala plays Rice than if Bala plays Cassava as well.
In the dominant strategy equilibrium Anil and Bala have specialized in producing the good for which their land is better suited. Simply pursuing their self-interestchoosing the strategy for which they got the highest payoffresulted in an outcome that was:

the best of the four possible outcomes for each player
the strategy that yielded the largest total payoffs for the two farmers combined

In this example, the dominant strategy equilibrium is the outcome that each would have chosen if they had a way of coordinating their decisions. Although they independently pursued their self-interest, they were guided as if by an invisible hand to an outcome that was in both of their best interests.
Real economic problems are never this simple, but the basic logic is the same. The pursuit of self-interest without regard for others is sometimes considered to be morally bad, but the study of economics has identified cases in which it can lead to outcomes that are socially desirable. There are other cases, however, in which the pursuit of self-interest leads to results that are not in the self-interest of any of the players. The prisoners dilemma game, which we study next, describes one of these situations.

Question 4.2 Choose the correct answer(s)
Brian likes going to the cinema more than watching football. Anna, on the other hand, prefers watching football to going to the cinema. If one person chooses their favourite activity, the other person prefers to spend time together rather than spend an afternoon apart. The following table represents the happiness levels (payoffs) of Anna and Brian, depending on their choice of activity (the first number is Brians happiness level while the second number is Annas):












Based on the information above, we can conclude that:

The dominant strategy for both players is Football.
There is no dominant strategy equilibrium.
The dominant strategy equilibrium yields the highest possible happiness for both.
Neither player would want to deviate from the dominant strategy equilibrium.


For Brian, the dominant strategy is Cinema.
The dominant strategy equilibrium is the outcome in which each player plays his/her dominant strategy. In this game it is (Cinema, Football), with the payoff (4, 3).
Brian would attain the highest happiness level if they could go to the cinema together. Similarly, Anna would be happiest if they both watched football.
(Cinema, Football) is a dominant strategy equilibrium. The lack of any incentive to deviate is a feature of any dominant strategy equilibrium.



When economists disagree Homo economicus in question: Are people entirely selfish?
For centuries, economists and just about everyone else have debated whether people are entirely self-interested or are sometimes happy to help others even when it costs them something to do so. Homo economicus (economic man) is the nickname given to the selfish and calculating character that you find in economics textbooks. Have economists been right to imagine homo economicus as the only actor on the economic stage?
In the same book in which he first used the phrase invisible hand, Adam Smith also made it clear that he thought we were not homo economicus: How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. (The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759)
But most economists since Smith have disagreed. In 1881, Francis Edgeworth, a founder of modern economics, made this perfectly clear in his book Mathematical Psychics: The first principle of economics is that every agent is actuated only by self-interest.6
Yet everyone has experienced, and sometimes even performed, great acts of kindness or bravery on behalf of others in situations in which there was little chance of a reward. The question for economists is: should the unselfishness evident in these acts be part of how we reason about behaviour?
Some say no: many seemingly generous acts are better understood as attempts to gain a favourable reputation among others that will benefit the actor in the future.
Maybe helping others and observing social norms is just self-interest with a long time horizon. This is what the essayist H.L.Mencken thought: conscience is the inner voice which warns that somebody may be looking.7
Since the 1990s, in an attempt to resolve the debate on empirical grounds, economists have performed hundreds of experiments all over the world in which the behaviour of individuals (students, farmers, whale hunters, warehouse workers, and CEOs) can be observed as they make real choices about sharing, using economic games.

reciprocityA preference to be kind or to help others who are kind and helpful, and to withhold help and kindness from people who are not helpful or kind.inequality aversionA dislike of outcomes in which some individuals receive more than others.

In these experiments, we almost always see some self-interested behaviour. But we also observe altruism, reciprocity, aversion to inequality, and other preferences that are different from self-interest. In many experiments homo economicus is the minority. This is true even when the amounts being shared (or kept for oneself) amount to many days wages.
Is the debate resolved? Many economists think so and now consider people who are sometimes altruistic, sometimes inequality averse, and sometimes reciprocal, in addition to homo economicus. They point out that the assumption of self-interest is appropriate for many economic settings, like shopping or the way that firms use technology to maximize profits. But its not as appropriate in other settings, such as how we pay taxes, or why we work hard for our employer.
