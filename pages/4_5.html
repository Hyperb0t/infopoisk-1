4.4 Social preferences: Altruism
When students play one-shot prisoners dilemma games in classroom or laboratory experimentssometimes for substantial sums of real moneyit is common to observe half or more of the participants playing the Cooperate rather than Defect strategy, despite mutual defection being the dominant strategy for players who care only about their own monetary payoffs. One interpretation of these results is that players are altruistic.
For example, if Anil had cared sufficiently about the harm that he would inflict on Bala by using Terminator when Bala was using IPC, then IPC would have been Anils best response to Balas IPC. And if Bala had felt the same way, then IPC would have been a mutual best response, and the two would no longer have been in a prisoners dilemma.
A person who is willing to bear a cost in order to help another person is said to have altruistic preferences. In the example just given, Anil was willing to give up 1 payoff unit because that would have imposed a loss of 2 on Bala. The cost to him of choosing IPC when Bala had chosen IPC was 1, and it conferred a benefit of 2 on Bala, meaning that he had acted altruistically.

social preferencesPreferences that place a value on what happens to other people, even if it results in lower payoffs for the individual.

The economic models we used in Unit 3 assumed self-interested preferences: Alexei, the student, and Angela, the farmer, cared about their own free time and their own grades or consumption. People generally do not care only about what happens to themselves, but also what happens to others. Then we say that the individual has social preferences. Altruism is an example of a social preference. Spite and envy are also social preferences.
Altruistic preferences as indifference curves
In previous units, we used indifference curves and feasible sets to model Alexeis and Angelas behaviour. We can do the same to study how people interact when social preferences are part of their motivation.
Imagine the following situation. Anil was given some tickets for the national lottery, and one of them won a prize of 10,000 rupees. He can, of course, keep all the money for himself, but he can also share some of it with his neighbour Bala. Figure 4.5 represents the situation graphically. The horizontal axis represents the amount of money (in thousands of rupees) that Anil keeps for himself, and the vertical one the amount that he gives to Bala. Each point (x, y) represents a combination of amounts of money for Anil (x) and Bala (y) in thousands of rupees. The shaded triangle depicts the feasible choices for Anil. At the corner (10, 0) on the horizontal axis, Anil keeps it all. At the other corner (0, 10) on the vertical axis, Anil gives it all to Bala. Anils feasible set is the shaded area.

zero sum gameA game in which the payoff gains and losses of the individuals sum to zero, for all combinations of strategies they might pursue.

The boundary of the shaded area is the feasible frontier. If Anil is dividing up his prize money between himself and Bala, he chooses a point on that frontier (being inside the frontier would mean throwing away some of the money). The choice among points on the feasible frontier is called a zero sum game because, when choosing point B rather than point A as in Figure 4.5, the sum of Anils losses and Balas gains is zero (for example, Anil has 3,000 fewer rupees at B than at A, and Bala has 3,000 rupees at B and nothing at A).
Anils preferences can be represented by indifference curves, showing combinations of the amounts for Anil and Bala that are all equally preferred by Anil. Figure 4.5 illustrates two cases. In the first, Anil has self-interested preferences so his indifference curves are straight vertical lines; in the second he is somewhat altruistiche cares about Balaso his indifference curves are downward-sloping.












Figure 4.5 
How Anil chooses to distribute his lottery winnings depends on whether he is selfish or altruistic.
        















Feasible payoffs


Each point (x, y) in the figure represents a combination of amounts of money for Anil (x) and Bala (y), in thousands of rupees. The shaded triangle depicts the feasible choices for Anil.














Indifference curves when Anil is self-interested


If Anil does not care at all about what Bala gets, his indifference curves are straight vertical lines. He is indifferent to whether Bala gets a lot or nothing. He prefers curves further to the right, since he gets more money.














Anils best option


Given his feasible set, Anils best option is A, where he keeps all the money.














What if Anil cares about Bala?


But Anil may care about his neighbour Bala, in which case he is happier if Bala is richer: that is, he derives utility from Balas consumption. In this case he has downward-sloping indifference curves.














Anils indifference curves when he is somewhat altruistic


Points B and C are equally preferred by Anil, so Anil keeping 7 and Bala getting 3 is just as good in Anils eyes as Anil getting 6 and Bala getting 5. His best feasible option is point B.




If Anil is self-interested, the best option given his feasible set is A, where he keeps all the money. If he derives utility from Balas consumption, he has downward-sloping indifference curves so he may prefer an outcome where Bala gets some of the money.
Leibniz: Finding the optimal distribution with altruistic preferences
With the specific indifference curves shown in Figure 4.5, the best feasible option for Anil is point B (7, 3) where Anil keeps 7,000 rupees and gives 3,000 to Bala. Anil prefers to give 3,000 rupees to Bala, even at a cost of 3,000 rupees to him. This is an example of altruism: Anil is willing to bear a cost to benefit somebody else.

Exercise 4.3 Altruism and selflessness
Using the same axes as in Figure 4.5:

What would Anils indifference curves look like if he cared just as much about Balas consumption as his own?
What would they look like if he derived utility only from the total of his and Balas consumption?
What would they look like if he derived utility only from Balas consumption?
For each of these cases, provide a real world situation in which Anil might have these preferences, making sure to specify how Anil and Bala derive their payoffs.



Question 4.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
In Figure 4.5 Anil has just won the lottery and has received 10,000 rupees. He is considering how much (if at all) he would like to share this sum with his friend Bala. Before he manages to share his winnings, Anil receives a tax bill for these winnings of 3,000 rupees. Based on this information, which of the following statements is true?

Bala will receive 3,000 rupees if Anil is somewhat altruistic.
If Anil was somewhat altruistic and kept 7,000 rupees before the tax bill, he will still keep 7,000 rupees after the tax bill by turning completely selfish.
Anil will be on a lower indifference curve after the tax bill.
Had Anil been so extremely altruistic that he only cared about Balas share, then Bala would have received the same income before and after the tax bill.


Without the tax Anil would have given exactly 3,000 rupees to Bala. With the total income now at 7,000 rupees, Anil will choose to give less than this.
We assume that preferences are fixed. Hence Anil will remain somewhat altruistic and give Bala some of his winnings.
The tax bill can be depicted as an inward shift of the feasible frontier. Therefore, Anils optimal choice will result in him being on a lower indifference curve than before.
Bala would have received 10,000 and 7,000 rupees respectively before and after the tax bill.
