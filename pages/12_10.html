12.9 Market failure and government policy
Figure 12.13 brings together the examples we have seen in which markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. At first sight they seem different from each other, but in each one, we can identify an external benefit or cost that a decision-maker does not take into account. The table in Figure 12.14 shows that the fundamental source of market failure is an information problem: some important aspect of an interaction that cannot be observed by one of the parties, or cannot be verified by a court.
The table in Figure 12.13 also shows some possible remedies. Governments play an important role in the economy in their attempts to diminish the inefficiencies associated with many kinds of market failure. However, the same information problems can hamper a government seeking to use taxes, subsidies, or prohibitions to improve on the market outcome. For example, the French government eventually decided to ban the use of chlordecone rather than collect the information necessary to devise a tax on banana production or provide compensation to the fisheries.
Sometimes a combination of remedies is the best way to cope with these information problems and resulting market failures. An example is car insurance. In many countries, third-party insurance (covering damage to others) is compulsory to avoid the adverse selection problem that would occur if only the accident-prone drivers purchased insurance. To address the moral hazard problem of hidden actions, insurers sometimes require the installation of on-board monitoring devices so that prudent driving habits can be an enforceable part of the insurance contract.

Terms applied to this type of market failure




A firm uses a pesticide that runs off into waterways

Overuse of pesticide and overproduction of the crop for which it is used
Taxes, quotas, bans, bargaining, common ownership of all affected assets
Negative external effect, environmental spillover


You take an international flight
Increase in global carbon emissions
Private benefit, external cost
Overuse of air travel
Taxes, quotas
Public bad, negative external effect


You travel to work by car
Congestion for other road users
Private cost, external cost
Overuse of cars
Tolls, quotas, subsidized public transport
Common-pool resource, negative external effect


A firm invests in R&D
Other firms can exploit the innovation
Private cost, external benefit
Too little R&D
Publicly funded research, subsidies for R&D, patents
Public good, positive external effect


An employee on a fixed wage decides how hard to work
Hard work raises employers profits
Private cost, external benefit
Too little effort; wage above reservation wage; unemployment

Incomplete labour contract, hidden action, moral hazard


Someone who knows he has a serious health problem buys insurance
Loss for insurance company
Private benefit, external cost
Too little insurance offered; insurance premiums too high
Mandatory purchase of health insurance, public provision, mandatory health information sharing
Missing markets, adverse selection


Someone who has purchased car insurance decides how carefully to drive
Prudent driving contributes to insurance companys profits
Private cost, external benefit
Too little insurance offered; insurance premiums too high
Installing driver monitoring devices
Missing markets, moral hazard


Borrower devotes insufficient prudence or effort to the project in which the loan is invested
Project more likely to fail, resulting in non-repayment of loan
Private benefit, external cost
Excessive risk; too few loans issued to poor borrowers
Redistribute wealth; common responsibility for repayment of loans (Grameen Bank)
Moral hazard, credit market exclusion


Bank that is too big to fail makes risky loans
Taxpayers bear costs if bank fails
Private benefit, external cost
Excessively risky lending
Regulation of banking practices
Moral hazard


A monopoly, a firm producing a differentiated good, or a firm with declining AC sets P>MC (Unit 7)
Price is too high for some potential buyers
Private benefit, external cost
Too low a quantity sold
Competition policy, public ownership of natural monopolies
Imperfect competition, decreasing average costs, natural monopoly

Question
Answer




Why do market failures happen?
People, guided only by market prices, do not take account of the full effect of their actions on others


Why is the full effect of their actions on others not taken into account?
There are external benefits and costs that are not compensated by payments


Why are some benefits or costs not compensated?
No markets exist in which they can be traded


Why not? And why cant private bargaining and payments solve the problem?
The required property rights and contracts cannot be enforced by courts of law


What prevents property rights and contracts from being enforceable?
Asymmetric or non-verifiable information

Looking ahead: A broader role for governments
Most of the models so far in this course are microeconomic models: that is, models of the interactions between individual employers and employees, borrowers and lenders, firms and their customers, and firms competing with other firms. We have seen in this unit that problems of Pareto inefficiency may arise in these interactions, and governments have a role in addressing them. Governments also address problems of inequality and poverty by redistributing income from richer to poorer households. But public policies are aimed at many other objectives, including:

Moderating fluctuations in employment and inflation: In Unit 10 you learned that except for the very wealthy, people cannot borrow enough to sufficiently smooth their consumption over time in response to changes in their employment status and other shocks. Governments can help by adopting policies that moderate the fluctuations in peoples real incomes and employment (Units 1315).
Wages, profits, and productivity in the long run: In Units 2, 6, and 9 you studied how wages, profits, and the productivity of labour are determined. Governments have a role here, too, in adopting policies that will affect the bargaining power of employers and their workers, and in boosting the productivity of labour.

Understanding these aspects of public policy as well as policies concerning the global economy, the environment, inequality, and innovation, requires that we now develop a model of the economy as a whole, sometimes called macroeconomics. Our understanding of the labour market from Units 6 and 9, the credit market from Unit 10 and this unit and the process of innovation from Unit 2 provide the basis for our understanding of how the economy considered as a whole works. This will be the subject of the next unit.

Exercise 12.10 Market failure
Construct a table like the one in Figure 12.13 to analyse the possible market failures associated with the decisions below. In each case, can you identify which markets or contracts are missing or incomplete?

You inoculate your child with a costly vaccination against an infectious disease.
You use money that you borrow from the bank to invest in a highly risky project.
A fishing fleet moves from the overfished coastal waters of its own country to international waters.
A city airport increases its number of passenger flights by allowing nighttime departures.
You contribute to a Wikipedia page.
A government invests in research in nuclear fusion.
