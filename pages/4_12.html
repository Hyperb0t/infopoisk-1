4.11 Fair farmers, self-interested students?

This is not always the case. In experiments in Papua New Guinea offers of more than half of the pie were commonly rejected by Responders who preferred to receive nothing than to participate in a very unequal outcome even if it was in the Responders favour, or to incur the social debt of having received a large gift that might be difficult to reciprocate. The subjects were inequity averse, even if the inequality in question benefited them.15

If you are a Responder in the ultimatum game who cares only about your own payoffs, you should accept any positive offer because something, no matter how small, is always better than nothing. Therefore, in a world composed only of self-interested individuals, the Proposer would anticipate that the Responder would accept any offer and, for that reason, would offer the minimum possible amountone centknowing it would be accepted.
Does this prediction match the experimental data? No, it does not. As in the prisoners dilemma, we dont see the outcome we would predict if people were entirely self-interested. One-cent offers get rejected.
To see how farmers in Kenya and students in the US played this game, look at Figure 4.12. The height of each bar indicates the fraction of Responders who were willing to accept the offer indicated on the horizontal axis. Offers of more than half of the pie were acceptable to all of the subjects in both countries, as you would expect.

Notice that the Kenyan farmers are very unwilling to accept low offers, presumably regarding them as unfair, while the US students are much more willing to do so. For example, virtually all (90%) of the farmers would say no to an offer of one-fifth of the pie (the Proposer keeping 80%), while 63% of the students would accept such a low offer. More than half of the students would accept just 10% of the pie, but almost none of the farmers would.
Although the results in Figure 4.12 indicate that attitudes differ towards what is fair, and how important fairness is, nobody in the Kenyan and US experiments was willing to accept an offer of zero, even though by rejecting it they would also receive zero.

Exercise 4.8 Social preferences
Consider the experiment described in Figure 4.12:

Which of the social preferences discussed above do you think motivated the subjects willingness to reject low offers, even though by doing so they would receive nothing at all?
Why do you think that the results differed between the Kenyan farmers and the US students?
What responses would you expect if you played this game with two different sets of playersyour classmates and your family? Explain whether or not you expect the results to differ across these groups. If possible, play the game with your classmates and your family and comment on whether the results are consistent with your predictions.


The full height of each bar in Figure 4.13 indicates the percentage of the Kenyan and American Proposers who made the offer shown on the horizontal axis. For example, half of the farmers made proposals of 40%. Another 10% offered an even split. Only 11% of the students made such generous offers.

What do the bars show?


The full height of each bar in the figure indicates the percentage of the Kenyan and American Proposers who made the offer shown on the horizontal axis.

Reading the figure


For example: for Kenyan farmers, 50% on the vertical axis and 40% on the horizontal axis means half of the Kenyan Proposers made an offer of 40%.

Costly Punishment Across Human Societies. Science 312 (5781): pp.17671770.














The dark-shaded area shows rejections


If Kenyan farmers made an offer of 30%, almost half of Responders would reject it. (The dark part of the bar is almost as big as the light part.)

Costly Punishment Across Human Societies. Science 312 (5781): pp.17671770.














Better offers, fewer rejections


The relative size of the dark area is smaller for better offers: for example Kenyan farmer Responders rejected a 40% offer only 4% of the time.

But were the farmers really generous? To answer, you have to think not only about how much they were offering, but also what they must have reasoned when considering whether the Respondent would accept the offer. If you look at Figure 4.13 and concentrate on the Kenyan farmers, you will see that very few proposed to keep the entire pie by offering zero (4% of them as shown in the far left-hand bar) and all of those offers would have been rejected (the entire bar is dark).
On the other hand, looking at the far right of the figure, we see that for the farmers, making an offer of half the pie ensured an acceptance rate of 100% (the entire bar is light). Those who offered 30% were about equally likely to see their offer rejected as accepted (the dark part of the bar is nearly as big as the light part).
A Proposer who wanted to earn as much as possible would choose something between the extreme of trying to take it all or dividing it equally. The farmers who offered 40% were very likely to see their offer accepted and receive 60% of the pie. In the experiment, half of the farmers chose an offer of 40%. We would expect the offer to be rejected only 4% of the time, as can be seen from the dark-shaded part of the bar at the 40% offer in Figure 4.13.
Now suppose you are a Kenyan farmer and all you care about is your own payoff.
Offering to give the Responder nothing is out of the question because that will ensure that you get nothing when they reject your offer. Offering half will get you half for surebecause the respondent will surely accept.
But you suspect that you can do better.
A Proposer who cares only about his own payoffs will compare what is called the expected payoffs of the two offers: that is, the payoff that one may expect, given what the other person is likely to do (accept or reject) in case this offer is made. Your expected payoff is the payoff you get if the offer is accepted, multiplied by the probability that it will be accepted (remember that if the offer is rejected, the Proposer gets nothing). Here is how the Proposer would calculate the expected payoffs of offering 40% or 30%:


We cannot know if the farmers actually made these calculations, of course. But if they did, they would have discovered that offering 40% maximized their expected payoff. This motivation contrasts with the case of the acceptable offers in which considerations of inequality aversion, reciprocity, or the desire to uphold a social norm were apparently at work. Unlike the Responders, many of the Proposers may have been trying to make as much money as possible in the experiment and had guessed correctly what the Responders would do.
Similar calculations indicate that, among the students, the expected payoff-maximizing offer was 30%, and this was the most common offer among them. The students lower offers could be because they correctly anticipated that lowball offers (even as low as 10%) would sometimes be accepted. They may have been trying to maximize their payoffs and hoping that they could get away with making low offers.

Exercise 4.9 Offers in the ultimatum game

Why do you think that some of the farmers offered more than 40%? Why did some of the students offer more than 30%?
Why did some offer less than 40% (farmers) and 30% (students)?
Which of the social preferences that you have studied might help to explain the results shown?


How do the two populations differ? Although many of the farmers and the students offered an amount that would maximize their expected payoffs, the similarity ends there. The Kenyan farmers were more likely to reject low offers. Is this a difference between Kenyans and Americans, or between farmers and students? Or is it something related to local social norms, rather than nationality and occupation? Experiments alone cannot answer these interesting questions, but before you jump to the conclusion that Kenyans are more averse to unfairness than Americans, when the same experiment was run with rural Missourians in the US, they were even more likely to reject low offers than the Kenyan farmers. Almost every Missourian Proposer offered half the pie.

Question 4.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Consider an ultimatum game where the Proposer offers a proportion of $100 to the Responder, who can either accept or reject the offer. If the Responder accepts, both the Proposer and the Responder keep the agreed share, while if the Responder rejects, then both receive nothing. Figure 4.12 shows the results of a study that compares the responses of US university students and Kenyan farmers.
From this information, we can conclude that:

Kenyans are more likely to reject low offers than Americans.
Just over 50% of Kenyan farmers rejected the offer of the Proposer keeping 30%.
Both groups of Responders are indifferent between accepting and rejecting an offer of receiving nothing.
Kenyan farmers place higher importance on fairness than US students.


The Kenyan farmers in the experiment are more likely to reject low offers than the US students. This does not imply that all Kenyans are more likely to reject low offers than all Americans.
Just over 50% of Kenyan farmers rejected the offer of the Responder receiving 30%.
Both groups of Responders 100% rejected the offer of receiving nothing.
The fact that Kenyan farmers were more likely to reject unfair offers and thus forgo any income indicates that they value fairness more.



Question 4.11 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following table shows the percentage of the Responders who rejected the amount offered by the Proposers in the ultimatum game played by Kenyan farmers and US university students. The pie is $100.


Amount offered

$0
$10
$20
$30
$40
$50


Proportion rejected
Kenyan farmers
100%
100%
90%
48%
4%
0%


US students
100%
40%
35%
15%
10%
0%


From this information, we can say that:

The expected payoff of offering $30 is $4.50 for the US students.
The expected payoff of offering $40 is $6 for the US students.
The expected payoff of offering $20 is $8 for the Kenyan farmers.
The expected payoff of offering $10 is higher for the Kenyan farmers than for the US students.


The expected payoff is an 85% chance of keeping $70 = 0.85  70 = $59.50.
The expected payoff is a 90% chance of keeping $60 = 0.90  60 = $54.
The expected payoff is a 10% chance of keeping $80 = 0.10  80 = $8.
The probability of being rejected is higher for the Kenyan farmers than for the US students. The expected payoff is therefore lower for the farmers.



Exercise 4.10 Strikes and the ultimatum game
A strike over pay or working conditions may be considered an example of an ultimatum game.

To model a strike as an ultimatum game, who is the Proposer and who is the Responder?
Draw a game tree to represent the situation between these two parties.
Research a well-known strike and explain how it satisfies the definition of an ultimatum game.
In this section, you have been presented with experimental data on how people play the ultimatum game. How could you use this information to suggest what kind of situations might lead to a strike?
