9.5 The price-setting curve: Wages and profits in the whole economy
We have seen in Figure 9.9 that when the firm sets the price as a markup on its wage cost, this means that the price per unit of output is split into the profit per unit and the wage cost per unit. For the economy as a whole, when all firms set prices this way, output per worker (labour productivity, or equivalently, the average product of labour, called lambda, ) is split into real profit per worker /P and the real wage W/P.
Figure 9.10 shows the outcome of the price-setting decisions of firms in the whole economy and we use P to represent the economy-wide price level. The top horizontal line shows firms revenues per worker in real terms: the average product of labour. What we call the price-setting curve is not really much of a curve: it is just a single number that gives the value of the real wage that is consistent with the markup over costs, when all firms set their price to maximize their profits. The value of the real wage consistent with the markup does not depend on the level of employment in the economy, so it is shown as in Figure 9.10 as a horizontal line at the height of wPS.

Point B in Figures 9.10 and 9.11 on the price-setting curve shows the outcome of profit-maximizing price-setting behaviour of firms for the economy as a whole.

Point A


Point A is above the price-setting curve, which means that the real wage is higher than is consistent with a firms profit maximizing markup. If the real wage is too high, it means the markup is too low.














Point B


The firm will raise its price so as to move towards higher profits at point B. The increased price will mean that fewer goods are sold, and as this is true of all firms, total employment falls.














Point C


Below the price-setting curve, at a point like C, firms lower their prices and hire more people.














The profit-maximizing price


Point B is the firms profit-maximizing price and profit margin. Given economy-wide demand, total profits are lower at A and C for firms facing the demand curve in Figure 9.9.




Now think about point A in Figure 9.11, which corresponds to point A in Figure 9.9. Follow the steps in Figure 9.11 to see why the firm will raise its price so as to move towards higher profits at point B. The rise in price and the reduction in employment are indicated by the arrow at point A in Figure 9.11, which points down and to the left. It points down because the rise in prices implies a fall in the real wage, that is, the nominal wage divided by the price. It points left because a price increase implies a fall in output and employment.

Exercise 9.3 The price-setting curve
In your own words and using a diagram like Figure 9.9, explain why prices would fall and employment would increase if the economy were at point C in Figure 9.11 (the opposite of what happens at point A).

In Figure 9.10, above the price-setting curve, like point A, firms raise prices and cut employment. Below the price-setting curve, at a point like C, firms lower prices and hire more people. Given the level of demand in the economy as a whole, firms pricing and hiring behavior will push the economy to a point on the price-setting curve so that the level of employment and real wage are at a point like B.
What will determine the height of the price-setting curve? There are many influences once we consider the impact of public policies (as we will see later in this unit), but two things have an important influence on the price-setting curve, even in the absence of government intervention:

Competition: The intensity of competition in the economy determines the extent to which firms can charge a price that exceeds their costs, that is, the markup. The less the competition, the greater the markup. In Figure 9.9, a steeper demand curve, which results from less competition among firms, will lead to a higher markup and increase the profit per worker. Since this leads to higher prices across the whole economy, it implies lower real wages, pushing down the price-setting curve.
Labour productivity: For any given markup, the level of labour productivityhow much a worker produces in an hourdetermines the real wage. The greater the level of labour productivity (), the higher the real wage that is consistent with a given markup. In Figure 9.10, higher labour productivity shifts the dashed line upwards, and, keeping the markup unchanged, the price-setting curve will shift upwards, raising the real wage.

Question 9.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram depicts the price-setting curve. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?













At point A, the markup is too high, and therefore the firm will raise its price. This leads to lower demand for the good and hence lower employment towards B.
At point C, the real wage is too low and the markup is too high. Therefore the firm is able to increase profit by lowering prices and hiring more workers.
Higher competition implies a lower price-setting curve.
For any given markup, higher labour productivity implies a lower price-setting curve, which means a lower real wage.


At point A, the real wage is too high, which means that the markup is too low. The rest of the statement is correct.
Point B is the profit-maximizing point. Therefore the firm is able to increase its profit by moving from C to B, by lowering its price (which reduces the markup and increases the real wage) and hiring more workers.
Higher competition implies lower markup. This reduces the profit per worker. Since this leads to lower prices across the whole economy, it implies higher real wages, pushing up the price-setting curve.
Higher labour productivity means a higher average product of labour curve. For any given markup this means a higher price-setting curve, which means a higher real wage.



Einstein The price-setting curve
There are several steps to show how the price-setting curve for the economy as a whole results from the decisions of individual firms.
Step 1: The firm sets its price
To focus on what is essential, we assume the firms only costs are the wages it pays. (We are setting aside the opportunity cost of the capital goods which the workers use in producing the firms output.) We assume that on average a worker produces  units of output, which does not vary with the number of workers employed. We use the Greek letter lambda () for labour productivity. The firm pays the worker a wage W in dollars. Both labour productivity and wages can be measured per hour, per day or per year. In our numerical examples, we typically use hourly wages and productivity.
The unit labour cost is the wages paid to hire the amount of labour to produce one unit of the good. This is defined as:

For example: if W = $30 and  = 10, then unit labour cost is $3, that is $30/10 units = $3 per unit.
Recall from Unit 7 that the firm chooses its price so that the markup is inversely proportional to the elasticity of the demand curve it faces:

Or because we have assumed that marginal and average costs are equal, that is, MC = AC, we can say that the markup is just the fraction of the price of a good that goes to the profits of the firm. The elasticity of the firms demand curve is greater the more competition the firm faces from other firms, so the higher the elasticity, the lower the firms price and markup. We call the markup  (the Greek letter mu, rhyming with few):

Using our assumptions, the firms marginal (and average) cost is its unit labour cost (W/) , and we can say that the firm sets its price, p, so that:

Rearranging, and multiplying each side by  gives:

In words, this says:

When the firm sets its profit-maximizing price, this splits output per worker into the part that goes to employees as wages and the part that goes to owners as profits.
Step 2: The price level in the economy as a whole and the real wage
From the employees point of view, the real wage measures how much of her typical consumption she can purchase with an hours earnings. Since she buys many different goods and services, this depends on prices set by the firms throughout the economy, not just her own firm. We call the average price of the goods and services the worker consumes, P, which is an average of the different levels of p set by individual firms across the economy.
The real wage is the nominal wage divided by the economy-wide price level, P.

Step 3: Profits, wages, and the price-setting curve
We assume that the entire economy is made up of firms facing competition conditions similar to the single firm we have just studied. This means the price-setting problem from Step 1 applies to all firms in the economy, so we can use the price-setting equation to determine the economy-wide real wage:

In words, this says that:

This is the wage indicated by the price-setting curve.
