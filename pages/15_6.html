15.5 What happened to the Phillips curve?
The model in Figure 15.5 suggests that a policymaker who is able to adjust the level of aggregate demand can pick any combination of inflation and unemployment along the Phillips curve. But the data in Figure 15.6 suggests that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment is not a stable one. There is a mass of data points and no discernible, positively sloped Phillips curve.
Figure 15.6 shows the inflation and unemployment combinations for the US for each year between 1960 and 2014. Note that on the horizontal axis, the scale for the unemployment rate declines as we move to the right in the figure. A Phillips curve sketched through the observations in the 1960s gives a reasonably good picture of the inflation-unemployment trade-off in that decade. But that curve clearly does not fit in other periods. The figure shows how the Phillips curve changed over time.

Where is the Phillips curve?


The figure shows the inflation and unemployment combinations for the US for each year between 1960 and 2014.

A shifting curve


We can use the figure to show how the Phillips curve shifted over time.

The 1960s


The Phillips curve (PC) for the 1960s shows the economy was in a good state. The US could achieve combinations of relatively low inflation and unemployment.

The 1970s


In the early 1970s, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted up.

The 1970s


The curve shifts up again in the late 1970s.

The 1980s


And up again in the early 1980s, further worsening the trade-off between unemployment and inflation.

The 1990s


In the late 1990s to the present, the Phillips curve is low and flat.

In his presidential address to the American Economic Association in December 1967, Milton Friedman provided an explanation for why the Phillips curve is not stable. He referred to the recent experience in the US. Since 1966 unemployment had been steady, averaging 3.7%, but inflation had increased from 3.0% to 4.2%. He said that the only way unemployment could be kept as low as 3% was by allowing inflation to keep increasing: There is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off, he claimed.3 This is what Helmut Schmidt knew, but did not want to admit to the voters, in 1972.
If there is no permanent trade-off, then the Phillips curve is not a feasible set in the same way as the feasible consumption frontier was: the feasible consumption frontier stays in place when a different point on it is chosen. By contrast, Friedman, supported by evidence from many countries from the late 1960s, showed that if a government tries to keep unemployment too low the result will be not just higher inflation, but rising inflation as well.
Inflation means rising prices. Rising inflation means prices increasing at an ever-faster rate. This means that the Phillips curve would keep shifting upward.
