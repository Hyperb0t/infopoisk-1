How the interactions among the firms owners, managers, and employees influence wages, work, and profits, and how this affects the entire economy

The firm is an actor in the capitalist economy, and a stage on which interactions among the firms employees, managers, and owners are played out.
Hiring labour is different from buying other goods and services, and the contract between the employer and the employee is incomplete. It does not cover what the employer really cares about, which is how hard and well the employee works.
Incomplete contracts arise when important information, such as the employees effort, is asymmetric or non-verifiable.
In economics, employment is modelled as a principal (the employer) interacting with an agent (the employee).
The principalagent model can be used to study other relationships with incomplete contracts, such as the interaction between a lender and a borrower.
Firms do not pay the lowest wages possible. They set wages so that employees earn economic rents, to motivate them to work effectively, and stay with the firm.
Working together in firms brings mutual gains: profit for owners, and  economic rents for managers and employees. But rents also lead to involuntary unemployment in the economy.

Apples iPhone and iPad are iconic American hi-tech products, yet neither is assembled in the US. Until 2011 a single company, Foxconn, produced every iPhone and iPad in factories in China, mainly so that Apple could take advantage of lower costs, including wages.
The components of the iPhone and iPad for the most part do not come from China, but are sourced from around the world. Components such as the flash memory, display module, and touch screen are made by a number of different companies including Toshiba and Sharp in Japan. The microprocessor is made by Samsung in South Korea and other components, by Infineon in Germany. Like other firms, Apple makes profits by finding the supplier that can provide inputs at the lowest cost, whether the input is a component or labour, wherever in the world that supplier may be located.
The cost of assembling the components into the final product in China is smallmaking up only 4% of the total costcompared to the cost of components sourced from high-wage economies such as Germany and Japan. Almost half of Apples employees in the US sell Apple products rather than making them, while firms compete on a global scale to win the lucrative business of supplying Apple with its components. The cost of producing the iPhone is far lower than the price Apple charges: in 2016, a 32Gb iPhone 7 cost $224.80 to manufacture. Its price in the US was $649.

offshoringThe relocation of part of a firms activities outside of the national boundaries in which it operates. It can take place within a multinational company or may involve outsourcing production to other firms.

Apple is not alone in outsourcing (or offshoring) production to countries that are not the main market for the goods produced. In most manufacturing industries, firms based in rich countries have transferred a significant proportion of production, which was previously done by local employees, to poorer countries where wages are lower. But Apple and other firms are looking for more than cheap labour. Wages in some of Apples source countries such as Germany are higher than in the US.
Other industries, particularly garment manufacturing, have relocated primarily to low-wage economies. More than 97% of apparel and 98% of footwear sold in the US by American brands and retailers is made overseas. China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam are now among the worlds main exporters of textiles and clothing. At the time of the Industrial Revolution, the worlds largest exporter was Britain.
Also, in developing countries, additional business costs such as health and safety rules are far lower, and environmental regulations are often less strict.

firmEconomic organization in which private owners of capital goods hire and direct labour to produce goods and services for sale on markets to make a profit.

Apple, Samsung, and Toshiba are business organizations called firms. Not everyone is employed in a firm. For example, many farmers, carpenters, software developers or personal trainers work independently, as neither employee nor employer. While some people work for governments and not-for-profit organizations, the majority of people in rich nations make their living by working in a firm.
Firms are major actors in the economy and we will use this and the next unit to explain how they work. A firm is often referred to as if it were a person: we talk about the price Apple charges.
But while firms are actorsand in some legal systems are treated as if they were individualsfirms are also the stage on which the people who make up the firm (employees, managers, and owners) act out their sometimes common but sometimes competing interests. In our Economist in action video Richard Freeman, an economist who specializes in labour markets, explains some of the consequences of outsourcing for these actors.

Richard Freeman: You cant outsource responsibility


To understand the firm, we will model how employers set wages and employees respond. We have already seen, in earlier units, the importance of work, and firms, in the economy:

Work is how people produce their livelihoods. In deciding how much time to spend working, people face a trade-off between free time and the goods that they can produce, or the wage income that they can earn.
Production, wages, and living standards have grown through the innovation and adoption of new technologies by firms.
If a production process requires labour to be combined with other inputslike Angelas labour and Brunos landthen a voluntary contract between the owners of those inputs can determine how the surplus from their interaction will be shared between the two parties, depending on their bargaining power.
There are potential gains (to all concerned) from individuals specializing in tasks for which they have a comparative advantage.
The division of labour may be coordinated through market exchange. In Unit 1, specialization in grain and apples was coordinated through buying and selling grain and apples. In Unit 5, the interaction between Angela and Bruno was coordinated by a contract trading the use of land for a share of the crop.
Sometimes, however, people need to work together to produce something that will benefit all of them, and their success will depend on their preferences and strategies to discourage free riding.
Another way that work may be coordinated and combined with other inputs is by organization within a firm. The firms in Unit 2 produced cloth, deciding how much coal to buy and how many workers to employ.

We illustrated each of these conclusions using models that illuminate some aspects of the economy, while setting aside others. In Unit 2, we did not consider how the length of the working day was determined while the economy was growing. In Unit 3, we did not model how the wage or the marginal rate of transformation of free time into goods was determined when we analysed a decision on working hours. In Unit 2 we told a story of conflicting interests over wages, but we did not model strategic interaction and bargaining until Units 4 and 5. And in Unit 5 we used the story of just two (imaginary) people called Bruno and Angela to model how bargaining may affect the Pareto efficiency and fairness of allocations.
In this unit, we study how, in the modern capitalist economy, the coordination of labour takes place within firms. We model how wages are determined when there are conflicts of interest between employers and employees, and look at what this means for the sharing of the mutual gains that arise from cooperation in a firm.
In Unit 7, we look at the firm as an actor in its relationship with other firms and with its customers.
