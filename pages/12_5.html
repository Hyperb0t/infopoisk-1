12.4 Property rights, contracts, and market failures
In taking an action so as to maximize profits (choosing the level of banana production or the choice of pesticide) the plantation owners did not take account of the external costs they imposed on the fishermen. And they had no reason to take account of them: they had the right to pollute the fisheries.
The same is true for the overuse of antibiotics. A self-interested person has no reason to use antibiotics sparingly, because the superbug that may be created will probably infect someone else.
If the prices of chlordecone and the antibiotic were high enough, there would be no overuse. But the prices of these goods were based on the costs of production, and excluded costs that their use would inflict on others. As you have seen, the private cost to the user (how much he paid to acquire the good) fell short of the social cost for this reason.
Another example: when fuel costs are low, more people decide to drive to work rather than taking the train. The information conveyed by the low price does not include the environmental costs of deciding to drive. The effects on the decision-maker are termed private costs and benefits, while the total effects, including those inflicted or enjoyed by others, are social costs and benefits.

external diseconomyA negative effect of a production, consumption, or other economic decision, that is not specified as a liability in a contract. Also known as: external cost, negative externality. See also: external effect.external economyA positive effect of a production, consumption, or other economic decision, that is not specified as a benefit in a contract. Also known as: external benefit, positive externality. See also: external effect.

Costs inflicted on others (such as pollution and congestion that are worse because you drive to work) are termed external diseconomies or negative externalities, while uncompensated benefits conferred on others are external economies or positive externalities.
We can understand why these and other market failures are common by thinking about how they could be avoided.
How could the cost of driving to work accurately reflect all of the costs incurred by anyone, not just the private costs made by the decision-maker? The most obvious (if impractical) way would be to require the driver to pay everyone affected by the resultant environmental damage (or traffic congestion) an amount exactly equal to the damage inflicted. This is of course impossible to do, but it sets a standard of what has to be done or approximated if the price of driving to work is to send the correct message.
Something like this approach applies if you drive recklessly on the way to work, skid off the road, and crash into somebodys house. Tort law (the law of damages) in most countries would require you to pay for the damage to the house. You are held liable for the damages so that you would pay the cost you had inflicted on another.
Knowing this, you might think twice about driving to work (or at least slow down a bit when you are late). It will change your behaviour and the allocation of resources.
But while tort law in most countries covers some kinds of harm inflicted on others (reckless driving), other important external effects of driving your car (such as adding to air pollution or congestion) would not be covered . Here are two further examples:

A firm operates an incinerator that produces fumes: The fumes lower the surrounding air quality. Those being polluted do not have a right to clean air, which is the right that would be the basis for a claim for compensation from the firm. So the firm does not have to pay these costs.
You play music loudly at night and disturb the sleep of the people next door: Sleeping neighbours do not have an enforceable right not to be woken by your music. There is no way that your neighbours can make you pay them compensation for the inconvenience you cause.

Legal systems also fail to provide compensation for the benefits that ones actions confer on others:

A firm trains a worker who quits for a better job: The skills of the trained worker go with them to the new job. Therefore, even though a different firm receives the benefit, the firm that paid for the training cannot collect compensation from the new firm.
Kim, the farmer in Unit 4, contributes to the cost of an irrigation project while other farmers free-ride on Kims contribution: Kim has no way of claiming payment for this public-spirited act. The free-riders will not compensate Kim.
A country invests in reducing carbon emissions that lowers the risks of climate change for other countries: As we saw in Unit 4, unless a treaty guarantees compensation for the costs of reduced emissions, other countries do not need to pay for this. The environmental improvement for the other countries is an uncompensated benefit.


incomplete contractA contract that does not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of parties to the exchange (or of others).

Market failures occur in these examples because the external benefits and costs of a persons actions are not owned by anyone. Think about waste. If you redecorate your house and you tear up the floor or knock down a wall, you own the debris and you have to dispose of it, even if you need to pay someone to take it away. But this is not the case with fumes from the incinerator or loud music at night. You do not have a contract with the incinerator company specifying at what price you are willing to accept fumes, or with your neighbour about the price of the right to play music after 10pm. In these cases economists say that we have incomplete, missing, or unenforceable property rightsor, simply, incomplete contracts.

missing marketA market in which there is some kind of exchange that, if implemented, would be mutually beneficial. This does not occur due to asymmetric or non-verifiable information.

We saw an important example of an incomplete contract in Unit 6. In the employment relationship, the employer can pay for the workers time, but the contract cannot specify how much effort is to be put in. Likewise, the external effects of a persons actions are effects that are not governed by contracts. Another way to express the problem is to say that there is no market within which these external effects can be compensated. So economists also use the term missing markets to describe problems like this.
In the case of Weevokil pollution:

The fishermens property rights were incomplete: They did not own a right to clean water in their fisheries, which would enable them to receive compensation for pollution, and they could not purchase such a right.
There was no market for clean water.

Why dont countries just rewrite their laws to reward people for the benefits they confer on others, and make decision-makers pay for the costs they inflict on others?

verifiable informationInformation that can be used to enforce a contract.

In Unit 6, we reviewed the reasons why the kinds of complete contracts that would enforce these objectives are incomplete or unenforceable. These are that necessary information is either not available or not verifiable, the external effects are too complex or difficult to measure to be written into an enforceable contract, or there may be no legal system to enforce the contract (as in pollution, which crosses national borders). You can see in our example that it would not be possible to write a complete set of contracts in which each individual fisherman could receive compensation from each plantation for the effects on that fisherman of its individual decisions.
For these and other reasons, in most cases it is impractical to use tort law to make people liable for the costs they inflict on others, because we dont have that information. And it is equally infeasible to use the legal system to compensate people for the beneficial effects they have on others, for example, to pay those who keep beautiful gardens an amount equal to the pleasure this confers on those who pass their house. A court would have to know how much that pleasure was worth to each passerby.
In the five bulleted examples earlier in this section, the reason why uncompensated external costs and benefits occur is the same:

asymmetric informationInformation that is relevant to the parties in an economic interaction, but is known by some but not by others. See also: adverse selection, moral hazard.


Some information that is of concern to someone other than the decision-maker is non-verifiable or asymmetric information.
Therefore, there can be no contract or property rights ensuring that external effects will be compensated.
As a result, some of the social costs or benefits of the decision-makers actions will not be included (or will not be sufficiently important) in the decision-making process.


Exercise 12.6 Incomplete contracts
In each of the five cases above (incinerator, loud music, training, irrigation, and climate change):

Explain why the external effects are not (and possibly cannot be) covered by a complete contract.
What critical piece(s) of information required for a complete contract are asymmetric or non-verifiable?
