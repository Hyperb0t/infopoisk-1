2.7 Malthusian economics: Diminishing average product of labour
The historical evidence supports our model that uses relative prices and innovation rents to provide a simple account of the timing and the geographical spread of the permanent technological revolution.14
This is part of the explanation of the upward kink in the hockey stick. Explaining the long flat part of the stick is another story, requiring a different model.
Malthus provided a model of the economy that predicts a pattern of economic development consistent with the flat part of the GDP per capita hockey stick from Figure 1.1a in Unit 1. His model introduces concepts that are used widely in economics. One of the most important concepts is the idea of diminishing average product of a factor of production.
Diminishing average product of labour
To understand what this means, imagine an agricultural economy that produces just one good, grain. Suppose that grain production is very simpleit involves only farm labour, working on the land. In other words, ignore the fact that grain production also requires spades, combine harvesters, grain elevators, silos, and other types of buildings and equipment.

factors of productionThe labour, machinery and equipment (usually referred to as capital), land, and other inputs to a production process.

Labour and land (and the other inputs that we are ignoring) are called factors of production, meaning inputs into the production process. In the model of technological change above, the factors of production are energy and labour.

average productTotal output divided by a particular input, for example per worker (divided by the number of workers) or per worker per hour (total output divided by the total number of hours of labour put in).

We will use a further simplifying ceteris paribus assumption: that the amount of land is fixed and all of the same quality. Imagine that the land is divided into 800 farms, each worked by a single farmer. Each farmer works the same total hours during a year. Together, these 800 farmers produce a total of 500,000 kg of grain. The average product of a farmers labour is:


Production function
This describes the relationship between the amount of output produced and the amounts of inputs used to produce it.

To understand what will happen when the population grows and there are more farmers on the same limited space of farmland, we need something that economists call the production function for farming. This indicates the amount of output produced by any given number of farmers working on a given amount of land. In this case, we are holding constant all of the other inputs, including land, so we only consider how output varies with the amount of labour.
In the previous sections, you have already seen very simple production functions that specified the amounts of labour and energy necessary to produce 100 metres of cloth. For example, in Figure 2.3, the production function for technology B says that if 4 workers and 2 tonnes of coal are put into production, 100 metres of cloth will be the output. The production function for technology A gives us another if-then statement: if 1 worker and 6 tonnes of coal are put into production using this technology, then 100metres of cloth will be the output. The grain production function is a similar if-then statement, indicating that if there are X farmers, then they will harvest Y grain.
Figure 2.14a lists some values of labour input and the corresponding grain production. In the third column we have calculated the average product of labour. In Figure 2.14b, we draw the function, assuming that the relationship holds for all farmers and grain production amounts in between those shown in the table.
Leibniz: Malthusian Economics: Diminishing Average Product of Labour
We call this a production function because a function is a relationship between two quantities (inputs and outputs in this case), expressed mathematically as:

We say that Y is a function of X. X in this case is the amount of labour devoted to farming. Y is the output in grain that results from this input. The function f(X) describes the relationship between X and Y, represented by the curve in the figure.

The farmers production function


The production function shows how the number of farmers working the land translates into grain produced at the end of the growing season.














Output when there are 800 farmers


Point A on the production function shows the output of grain produced by 800 farmers.














Output when there are 1,600 farmers


Point B on the production function shows the amount of grain produced by 1,600 farmers.














The average product diminishes


At A, the average product of labour is 500,000  800 = 625 kg of grain per farmer. At B, the average product of labour is 732,000  1,600 = 458 kg of grain per farmer.














The slope of the ray is the average product


The slope of the ray from the origin to point B on the production function shows the average product of labour at point B. The slope is 458, meaning an average product of 458 kg per farmer when 1,600 farmers work the land.














The ray to A is steeper than the ray toB


The slope of the ray to point A is steeper than to point B. When only 800 farmers work the land there is a higher average product of labour. The slope is 625, the average product of 625 kg per farmer that we calculated previously.





Exercise 2.6 The farmers production function
In Unit 1 we explained that the economy is part of the biosphere. Think of farming biologically.

Find out how many calories a farmer burns, and how many calories are contained in 1 kg of grain.
Does farming produce a surplus of caloriesmore calories in the output than used up in the work inputusing the production function in Figure 2.14b?


Our grain production function is hypothetical, but it has two features that are plausible assumptions about how output depends on the number of farmers:
Labour combined with land is productive. No surprises there. The more farmers there are, the more grain is produced; at least up to a certain point (3,000 farmers, in this case).

diminishing average product of labourA situation in which, as more labour is used in a given production process, the average product of labour typically falls.

As more farmers work on a fixed amount of land, the average product of labour falls. This diminishing average product of labour is one of the two foundations of Malthus model.
Remember that the average product of labour is the grain output divided by the amount of labour input. From the production function in Figure 2.14b, or the table in Figure 2.14a (both show the same information) we see that an annual input of 800 farmers working the land brings an average per-farmer output of 625 kg of grain, while increasing the labour input to 1,600 farmers produces an average output per farmer of 458 kg. Theaverage product of labour falls as more labour is expended on production. This worried Malthus.
To see why he was worried, imagine that, a generation later, each farmer has had many children, so that instead of a single farmer working each farm, there are now two farmers working. The total labour input into farming was 800, but is now 1,600. Instead of a harvest of 625 kg of grain per farmer, the average harvest is now only 458 kg.
You might argue that in the real world, as the population grows, more land can be used for farming. But Malthus pointed out that earlier generations of farmers would have picked the best land, so any new land would be worse. This also reduces the average product of labour.
So diminishing average product of labour can be caused by:

more labour devoted to a fixed quantity of land
more (inferior) land brought into cultivation

Because the average product of labour diminishes as more labour is devoted to farming, their incomes inevitably fall.

Question 2.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Look again at Figure 2.14b which depicts the production function of grain for farmers under average growing conditions with the currently available technology.
We can ascertain that:

In a year with exceptionally good weather conditions, the production function curve will be higher and parallel to the curve above.
A discovery of new high-yielding crop seeds would tilt the production function curve higher, pivoted anti-clockwise at the origin.
In a year of bad drought, the production curve can slope downwards for large numbers of farmers.
If there is an upper limit on the amount of grain that can be produced, then the curve will end up horizontal for large numbers of farmers.


Zero farmers means zero output. Therefore, all curves must start at the origin, and cannot shift upwards or downwards in a parallel manner.
Such a discovery would increase the kilogrammes of grain produced for any given number of farmers (except zero); this can be represented graphically as an anti-clockwise pivot in the production function curve.
A downward-sloping curve implies decreasing output as the number of farmers increases. This would only be the case if the additional labourers have negative effects on the productivity of the existing labourers, which we normally rule out.
An upper limit implies that additional farmers would not yield any additional kilogrammes of grain, which would be represented graphically by a flat production function past the upper limit.
