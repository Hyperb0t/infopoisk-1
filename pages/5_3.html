5.2 Evaluating institutions and outcomes: The Pareto criterion
Whether it is fishermen seeking to make a living while not depleting the fish stocks, or farmers maintaining the channels of an irrigation system, or two people dividing up a pie, we want to be able to both describe what happens and to evaluate itis it better or worse than other potential outcomes? The first involves facts; the second involves values.

allocationA description of who does what, the consequences of their actions, and who gets what as a result.

We call the outcome of an economic interaction an allocation.
In the ultimatum game, for example, the allocation describes the proposed division of the pie by the Proposer, whether it was rejected or accepted, and the resulting payoffs to the two players.

The Pareto criterion
According to the Pareto criterion, allocation A dominates allocation B if at least one party would be better off with A than B, and nobody would be worse off.
We say that A Pareto dominates B.


Pareto dominantAllocation A Pareto dominates allocation B if at least one party would be better off with A than B, and nobody would be worse off. See also: Pareto efficient.

Now suppose that we want to compare two possible allocations, A and B, that may result from an economic interaction. Can we say which is better? Suppose we find that everyone involved in the interaction would prefer allocation A. Then most people would agree that A is a better allocation than B. This criterion for judging between A and B is called the Pareto criterion, after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist and sociologist.
Note that when we say an allocation makes someone better off we mean that they prefer it, which does not necessarily mean they get more money.

Great economists Vilfredo Pareto

Vilfredo Pareto (18481923), an Italian economist and sociologist, earned a degree in engineering for his research on the concept of equilibrium in physics. He is mostly remembered for the concept of efficiency that bears his name. He wanted economics and sociology to be fact-based sciences, similar to the physical sciences that he had studied when he was younger.
His empirical investigations led him to question the idea that the distribution of wealth resembles the familiar bell curve, with a few rich and a few poor in the tails of the distribution and a large middle-income class. In its place he proposed what came to be called Paretos law, according to which, across the ages and differing types of economy, there were very few rich people and a lot of poor people.
His 8020 rulederived from Paretos lawasserted that the richest 20% of a population typically held 80% of the wealth. Were he living in the US in 2015, he would have to revise that to 90% of the wealth held by the richest 20%, suggesting that his law might not be as universal as he had thought.
In Paretos view, the economic game was played for high stakes, with big winners and losers. Not surprisingly, then, he urged economists to study conflicts over the division of goods, and he thought the time and resources devoted to these conflicts were part of what economics should be about.2 In his most famous book, the Manual of Political Economy (1906), he wrote that: The efforts of men are utilized in two different ways: they are directed to the production or transformation of economic goods, or else to the appropriation of goods produced by others.

Figure 5.1 compares the four allocations in the pest control game from Unit4 by the Pareto criterion (using a similar method to the comparison of technologies in Unit 2). We assume that Anil and Bala are self-interested, so they prefer allocations with a higher payoff for themselves.
The blue rectangle with its corner at allocation (T, T) shows that (I, I) Pareto dominates (T, T). Follow the steps in Figure 5.1 to see more comparisons.

Anil and Balas prisoners dilemma


The diagram shows the allocations of the prisoners dilemma game played by Anil and Bala.














A Pareto comparison


(I, I) lies in the rectangle to the north-east of (T, T), so an outcome where both Anil and Bala use IPC Pareto dominates one where both use Terminator.














Compare (T, T) and (T, I)


If Anil uses Terminator and Bala IPC, then he is better off but Bala is worse off than when both use Terminator. The Pareto criterion cannot say which of these allocations is better.














No allocation Pareto dominates (I, I)


None of the other allocations lie to the north-east of (I, I), so it is not Pareto dominated.














What can we say about (I, T) and (T,I)?


Neither of these allocations are Pareto dominated, but they do not dominate any other allocations either.




You can see from this example that the Pareto criterion may be of limited help in comparing allocations. Here, it tells us only that (I, I) is better than (T, T).

Pareto efficientAn allocation with the property that there is no alternative technically feasible allocation in which at least one person would be better off, and nobody worse off.

The diagram also shows that three of the four allocations are not Pareto dominated by any other. An allocation with this property is called Pareto efficient.

Pareto efficiency
An allocation that is not Pareto dominated by any other allocation is described as Pareto efficient.


Pareto criterionAccording to the Pareto criterion, a desirable attribute of an allocation is that it be Pareto-efficient. See also: Pareto dominant.

If an allocation is Pareto efficient, then there is no alternative allocation in which at least one party would be better off and nobody worse off. The concept of Pareto efficiency is very widely used in economics and sounds like a good thing, but we need to be careful with it:

There is often more than one Pareto-efficient allocation: In the pest-control game there are three.
The Pareto criterion does not tell us which of the Pareto-efficient allocations is better: It does not give us any ranking of (I, I), (I, T) and (T,I).
If an allocation is Pareto efficient, this does not mean we should approve of it: Anil playing IPC and Bala free riding by playing Terminator is Pareto efficient, but we (and Anil) may think this is unfair. Pareto efficiency has nothing to do with fairness.
Allocation (T, I) is Pareto efficient and (T, T) is not (it is Pareto inefficient): But the Pareto criterion does NOT tell us which is better.

There are many Pareto-efficient allocations that we would not evaluate favourably. If you look back at Figure 4.5 you can see that any split of Anils lottery winnings (including giving Bala nothing) would be Pareto efficient (choose any point on the boundary of the feasible set of outcomes, and draw the rectangle with its corner at that point: there are no feasible points above and to the right). But some of these splits would seem very unfair. Similarly, in the ultimatum game an allocation of one cent to the Responder and $99.99 to the Proposer is also Pareto efficient, because there is no way to make the Responder better off without making the Proposer worse off.
The same is true of problems such as the allocation of food. If some people are more than satisfied while others are starving, we might say in everyday language: This is not a sensible way to provide nutrition. It is clearly inefficient. But Pareto efficiency means something different. A very unequal distribution of food can be Pareto efficient as long as all the food is eaten by someone who enjoys it even a little.

Question 5.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements about the outcome of an economic interaction is correct?

If the allocation is Pareto efficient, then you cannot make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.
All participants are happy with what they get if the allocation is Pareto efficient.
There cannot be more than one Pareto-efficient outcome.
According to the Pareto criterion, a Pareto-efficient outcome is always better than an inefficient one.


If the allocation is Pareto efficient, there is no allocation that Pareto dominates it: that is, no allocation where someone is better off without others being worse off.
Pareto-efficient allocations can be very unfair, in which case it is likely that at least one participant would not be happy with the outcome.
There can be more than one Pareto-efficient outcome. We saw that three of the four allocations in the pest control game were Pareto efficient.
It is possible that one of the participants is worse off in the Pareto-efficient outcome, in which case it would not be better by the Pareto criterion. In the pest control game (T, I) is efficient but not better than (T, T).
