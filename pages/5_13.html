5.12 Measuring economic inequality
In our analysis of the interaction between Angela and Bruno, we have assessed the allocations in terms of Pareto efficiency. We have seen that they (or at least one of them) can be better off if they can negotiate a move from a Pareto-inefficient allocation to one on the Pareto efficiency curve.
But the other important criterion for assessing an allocation is fairness. We know that Pareto-efficient allocations can be highly unequal. In the case of Angela and Bruno, inequality resulted directly from differences in bargaining power, but also from differences in their endowments: that is, what they each owned before the interaction (their initial wealth). Bruno owned land, while Angela had nothing except time and the capacity to work. Difference in endowments, as well as institutions, may in turn affect bargaining power.
It is easy to assess the distribution between two people. But how can we assess inequalities in larger groups, or across a whole society? A useful tool for representing and comparing distributions of income or wealth, and showing the extent of inequality, is the Lorenz curve (invented in 1905 by Max Lorenz (18761959), an American economist, while he was still a student). It indicates how much disparity there is in income, or any other measure, across the population.4

Lorenz curveA graphical representation of inequality of some quantity such as wealth or income. Individuals are arranged in ascending order by how much of this quantity they have, and the cumulative share of the total is then plotted against the cumulative share of the population. For complete equality of income, for example, it would be a straight line with a slope of one. The extent to which the curve falls below this perfect equality line is a measure of inequality. See also: Gini coefficient.

The Lorenz curve shows the entire population lined up along the horizontal axis from the poorest to the richest. The height of the curve at any point on the horizontal axis indicates the fraction of total income received by the fraction of the population given by that point on the horizontal axis.
To see how this works, imagine a village in which there are 10 landowners, each owning 10 hectares, and 90 others who farm the land as sharecroppers, but who own no land (like Angela). The Lorenz curve is the blue line in Figure 5.12. Lining the population up in order of land ownership, the first 90% of the population own nothing, so the curve is flat. The remaining 10% own 10 hectares each, so the curve rises in a straight line to reach the point where 100% of people own 100% of the land.

A Lorenz curve for wealth ownership.
        




If instead each member of the population owned one hectare of landperfect equality in land ownershipthen the Lorenz curve would be a line at a 45-degree angle, indicating that the poorest 10% of the population have 10% of the land, and so on (although in this case, everyone is equally poor, and equally rich).
The Lorenz curve allows us to see how far a distribution departs from this line of perfect equality. Figure 5.13 shows the distribution of income that would have resulted from the prize-sharing system described in the articles of the pirate ship, the Royal Rover, discussed in the introduction to this unit. The Lorenz curve is very close to the 45-degree line, showing how the institutions of piracy allowed ordinary members of the crew to claim a large share of income.
In contrast, when the Royal Navys ships Favourite and Active captured the Spanish treasure ship La Hermione, the division of the spoils on the two British men-of-war ships was far less equal. The Lorenz curves show that ordinary crew members received about a quarter of the income, with the remainder going to a small number of officers and the captain. You can see that the Favourite was more unequal that the Active, with a lower share going to each crew member. By the standards of the day, pirates were unusually democratic and fair-minded in their dealings with each other.

The Gini coefficient

Gini coefficientA measure of inequality of any quantity such as income or wealth, varying from a value of zero (if there is no inequality) to one (if a single individual receives all of it).

The Lorenz curve gives us a picture of the disparity of income across the whole population, but it can be useful to have a simple measure of the degree of inequality. You can see that more unequal distributions have a greater area between the Lorenz curve and the 45-degree line. The Gini coefficient (or Gini ratio) named after the Italian statistician Corrado Gini (18841965), is calculated as the ratio of this area to the area of the whole of the triangle under the 45-degree line.
If everyone has the same income, so that there is no income inequality, the Gini coefficient takes a value of 0. If a single individual receives all the income, the Gini coefficient takes its maximum value of 1. We can calculate the Gini for land ownership in Figure 5.14a as area A, between the Lorenz curve and the perfect equality line, as a proportion of area (A + B), the triangle under the 45-degree line:

Strictly speaking, this method of calculating the Gini gives only an approximation. The Gini is more precisely defined as a measure of the average difference in income between every pair of individuals in the population, as explained in the Einstein at the end of this section. The area method gives an accurate approximation only when the population is large.
Comparing income distributions and inequality across the world

disposable incomeIncome available after paying taxes and receiving transfers from the government.

To assess income inequality within a country, we can either look at total market income (all earnings from employment, self-employment, savings and investments), or disposable income, which better captures living standards. Disposable income is what a household can spend after paying tax and receiving transfers (such as unemployment benefit and pensions) from the government:













In Unit 1, we compared inequality in the income distributions of countries using the 90/10 ratio. Lorenz curves give us a fuller picture of how distributions differ. Figure 5.15 shows the distribution of market income in the Netherlands in 2010. The Gini coefficient is 0.47, so by this measure it has greater inequality than the Royal Rover, but less than the British Navy ships. The analysis in Figure 5.15 shows how redistributive government policies result in a more equal distribution of disposable income.

The Lorenz curve for market income


The curve indicates that the poorest 10% of the population (10 on the horizontal axis) receive only 0.1% of total income (0.1 on the vertical axis), and the lower-earning half of the population has less than 20% of income.

The Gini for market income


The Gini coefficient is the ratio of area A (between the market income curve and the perfect equality line) to area A + B (below the perfect equality line), which is 0.47.

Disposable income


The amount of inequality in disposable income is much smaller than the inequality in market income. Redistributive policies have a bigger effect towards the bottom of the distribution. The poorest 10% have 4% of total disposable income.

The Gini for disposable income


The Gini coefficient for disposable income is lower: the ratio of areas A (between the disposable income curve and the perfect equality line) and A + B (below the perfect equality line) is 0.25.




Notice that in the Netherlands, almost one-fifth of the households have a near-zero market income, but most nonetheless have enough disposable income to survive, or even live comfortably: the poorest one-fifth of the population receive about 10% of all disposable income.
There are many different ways to measure income inequality besides the Gini and the 90/10 ratio, but these two are widely used. Figure 5.16 compares the Gini coefficients for disposable and market income across a large sample of countries, ordered from left to right, from the least to the most unequal by the disposable income measure. The main reason for the substantial differences between nations in disposable income inequality is the extent to which governments can tax well off families and transfer the proceeds to the less well off.
Notice that:

The differences between countries in disposable income inequality (the top of the lower bars) are much greater than the differences in inequality of market incomes (the top of the upper bars).
The US and the UK are among the most unequal of the high-income economies.
The few poor and middle-income countries for which data are available are even more unequal in disposable income than the US but 
 (with the exception of South Africa) this is mainly the result of the limited degree of redistribution from rich to poor, rather than unusually high inequality in market income.

We study redistribution of income by governments in more detail in Unit 19 (Inequality).

Question 5.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 5.15 shows the Lorenz curve for market income in the Netherlands in 2010.
Which of the following is true?

If area A increases, income inequality falls.
The Gini coefficient can be calculated as the proportion of area A toarea A + B.
Countries with lower Gini coefficients have less equal income distributions.
The Gini coefficient takes the value 1 when everyone has the same income.


If area A increases, then inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) rises.
This method can be used when the population is large, as it is for a whole country such as the Netherlands.
Countries with lower Gini coefficients have lower inequality (by this measure) hence a more equal income distribution.
The coefficient takes the value zero when all have the same income (the Lorenz curve is on the perfect equality line).



Exercise 5.9 Comparing distributions of wealth
The table shows three alternative distributions of land ownership in a village with 100 people and 100 hectares of land. Draw the Lorenz curves for each case. For cases I and III calculate the Gini. For case II, show on the Lorenz curve diagram how the Gini coefficient can be calculated.



I
80 people own nothing
20 people own 5hectares each



II
40 people own nothing
40 people own 1hectare each
20 people own 3hectares each


III
100 people own 1hectare each







Einstein Inequality as differences among people
The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, precisely defined as:

To calculate g, you should know the incomes of every member of a population:

Find the difference in income between every possible pair in the population.
Take the mean of these differences.
Divide this number by the mean income of the population, to get the relative mean difference.
g = relative mean difference divided by two.

Examples:
There are just two individuals in the population and one has all the income. Assume their incomes are 0 and 1.

The difference between the incomes of the pair = 1.
This is the mean difference because there is just one pair.
Mean income = 0.5, so the relative mean difference = 1/0.5 = 2.
g = 2/2 = 1 (perfect inequality, as we would expect).

Two people are dividing a pie: one has 20%, and the other 80%.

The difference is 60% (0.60).
This is the mean difference (there are only two incomes, as before).
Mean income is 50% or 0.50. The relative mean difference is 0.6/0.5 = 1.20.
g = 0.60.

The Gini coefficient is a measure of how unequal their slices are. As an exercise, confirm that if the size of the smaller slice of the pie is  , g = 1  2.
There are three people, and one has all of the income, which we assume is 1 unit.

The differences for the three possible pairs are 1, 1, and 0.
Mean difference = 2/3.
Relative mean difference = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2.
g = 2/2 = 1.

Approximating the Gini using the Lorenz curve
If the population is large, we obtain a good approximation to the Gini coefficient using the areas in the Lorenz diagram: g  A/(A + B).
But with a small number of people, this approximation is not accurate.
You can see this if you think about the case of perfect inequality when one individual gets 100% of the income, for which the true Gini is 1, whatever the size of the population (we calculated it for populations of 2 and 3 above). The Lorenz curve is horizontal at zero up to the last individual, and then shoots up to 100%. Try drawing the Lorenz curves when the size of the population, N, is 2, 3, 10, and 20.

When N = 2 , A/(A + B) = 0.5, a very poor approximation to the true value, g = 1.
When N is large, area A is not quite as big as area A + B, but the ratio is almost 1.

There is a formula that calculates the correct Gini coefficient from the Lorenz diagram:

(Check for yourself that this works for the perfect inequality case when N = 2.)
