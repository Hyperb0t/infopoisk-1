12.7 Incomplete contracts and external effects in credit markets
We discussed borrowing and lending in Unit 10. Borrowing and lending is a principalagent problem in which the prudent use of the borrowed funds; hard work to ensure the success of the project for which the funds were borrowed; and the repayment of the loan, cannot be secured by means of an enforceable contract.
As a result, the decisions of the borrowerhard work, prudencehave external effects on the lender. What the borrower does affects the profits of the lender but is external to the contract. They are not covered in the contract because critical information that would be necessary to write them into a contacthow prudently the borrower ran the project, or how hard she worked for its successis not available to the lender, and even if it were, in most cases it would not be sufficient to enforce the necessary contracts.
Notice how similar this is to the problems of an employee making effort or an insured person taking care. They are all moral hazard problems.
The fundamental problem in the case of credit is that because the borrower may not repay the loan in the event of a failed project, she will take risks that she would have avoided if she had to bear the full cost of a bad outcome. This means that the project is more likely to fail, imposing costs on the lender.

equityAn individuals own investment in a project. This is recorded in an individuals or firms balance sheet as net worth. See also: net worth. An entirely different use of the term is synonymous with fairness.collateralAn asset that a borrower pledges to a lender as a security for a loan. If the borrower is not able to make the loan payments as promised, the lender becomes the owner of the asset.

As we saw in Unit 10, this will make the lender reluctant to make loans unless the borrower can be given an incentive not to take undue risk, either by investing some of her own funds in the project for which she is seeking funding (equity) or by providing collateral to the lender. This means that a person with little wealth may not be able to get a loan, even for a project that would have used the resources in a highly productive way, for example a new business, the cost of a license to practice a trade, or training.
To put it another way, lenders are willing to trade-off project quality to get a borrower who has more equity or more collateral. Sometimes a high-quality project from a poor would-be borrower is not funded by the lender, while a rich individual with a middling project gets a loan, as illustrated in Figure 12.11.

Thus poor borrowers may be credit-constrained or credit-excluded. This is another form of market failure, which arises particularly when wealth is very unequally distributed. Remember from Unit 10 how the Grameen Bank addressed this problem by making groups of borrowers jointly responsible for loan repayment, giving them an incentive to work hard and take prudent decisions without the need for equity or collateral.
Credit market failures also occur for another reason. When a bank makes a loan, it takes account of the possibility that it may not be repaid: if the interest rate it can charge is sufficiently high, even quite risky loans (like payday loans) may be a good bet. But the bank also worries about what might happen to its profits should most of its borrowers be unable to pay, as would happen if it had extended mortgages for home purchases during a boom in housing prices, and then the housing bubble burst. The bank could fail.

too big to failSaid to be a characteristic of large banks, whose central importance in the economy ensures they will be saved by the government if they are in financial difficulty. The bank thus does not bear all the costs of its activities and is therefore likely to take bigger risks. See also: moral hazard.

If the owners of the bank would bear all of the costs of a bankruptcy, then they would make strenuous efforts to avoid it. But the owners are unlikely to bear the full costs, for two reasons:

The bank will typically have borrowed from other banks: Just like the farmer borrowing to plant his crop, the bank owners will know that some of the costs of bankruptcy will be borne by other banks that will not be repaid.
Too big to fail: If the bank is sufficiently important in the economy, then the prospect of its failure is likely to provoke a bailout of the bank by the government, subsidizing it with tax revenue.

So again, the bank owners know that others (taxpayers or other banks) will bear some of the costs of their risk-taking. They then take more risks than they would if they were to bear all of the costs of their actions. Like environmental spillovers, excess risk-taking by banks and borrowers is a negative external effect leading to a market failure.
Those who may get stuck with the risk-takers losses try to protect themselves. Governments seek to regulate the banking system, limiting bank leverage so that banks would theoretically have sufficient resources to repay their debts.
We can add the credit market examples to our table of market failures in Figure 12.12.

Question 12.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct?

The problem with the credit market is that rich people will always get a loan irrespective of the quality of their project.
It is easier for rich people to get loans because they are able to provide equity or collateral.
Banks are described as too big to fail when their large size makes them safe institutions.
Banks that are too big to fail are careful not to make risky loans.


The rich may not get a loan if the project quality is low. The problem is more that poor people do not get a loan even if the project is of high quality.
Lenders can reduce the moral hazard problem by requiring equity or collateral, which only richer people are able to provide.
Banks are too big to fail if they are too important for the continued functioning of the economy for the government to allow them to fail.
These banks may make riskier loans, because they know the government will rescue them if they fail.
