9.4 The firms hiring decision
In order to understand the second component of the labour market modelthe price-setting curvewe need to look more carefully at the firms decision about how many people to hire, and how this depends on the amount that it produces. The amount produced depends on the amount that the firm is able to sell, which in turn depends on the price that it charges.
The firms decision comes from the interaction between the firms three departments. Recall in our model they are human resources (HR), the marketing department, and the production department (PD). Remember this firm has only one inputlabourso the wage is the only cost. And to make things even simpler, we assume that one hour of labour produces one unit of output (average product of labour =  = 1). So the wage the firm pays (W) is the cost of a unit of output (in the relevant currency unit). Note that W is the nominal wage and w is the real wage.
The process is summarized in the table in Figure 9.8.

Once HR has set the wage at a level sufficient to motivate the workforce, the marketing department proceeds in two steps. Remember that the firm can set the price but not the quantity that it will be able to sell (quantity sold depends on the amount demanded at each price on the firms demand curve). So first, as in Unit 7, the marketing department asks: which combinations of p and q are feasible? These combinations are shown by the demand curve, which will depend on the amounts that other firms are producing, the prices they are setting, the wages they are paying, and other influences on the total level of demand for goods in the economy.
Step two is to pick a point on the demand curve, so the marketing department looks at Figure 9.9 to determine how profitable each price-quantity combination would be. Using the value of W chosen by HR, the marketing department constructs the isoprofit curves shown. Recall that each curve is the collection of all combinations of price and quantity that will yield the firm the same level of profit, given the wage. Curves further out from the origin (higher price and quantity) indicate higher profits. Recall that:

As in Unit 7, maximum profits occur at point B, where the demand curve is tangent to an isoprofit curve. The marketing department thus sets a price p*, and calculates that it will be able to sell q* units of the goods.

Maximum profits


The maximum profits occur at point B where the firms demand curve is tangent to an isoprofit curve.














The firms price decision


This determines the division of the total revenue between profits and wages.




When the firm sells q* goods at a price p*, its total revenue is p*q*. Notice from the figure that once the firm has set a price, it has determined the division of the total revenue between profits and wages. This is based on the markup (p  W)/p (or 1  (W/p)). As you have seen from Unit 7, this is greater when the demand curve is less elastic, indicating less intense competition.
The PD knows that each hour of a workers time (working at the speed they are motivated to work by their employment rent and the threat of termination) produces a single unit of the good so it hires n* workers hours of labour, where n* = q*. This is the firms (very simple) production function.
It will help in the next section to think about how the model explains what the firm would do if it found itself at a point like A. The marketing department would see that the firm was making lower profits because the isoprofit curve at A is lower than at point B. The marketing department would then raise the price and inform the PD that it should produce less. Similarly, if the firm were at point C, the marketing department would lower its price and the PD would get the message to produce more, to meet the higher sales at the lower price.

Question 9.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 9.9 depicts the markets demand curve and the firms isoprofit curves. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The slope of the demand curve is the firms marginal rate of substitution.
Between points A and C, the firm would prefer point A as the output is higher.
Having chosen its profit-maximizing price p*, the firm would then set its nominal wage level.
If the firm finds itself producing at point C, it can increase its profit by selling more units at a lower price.


The firms marginal rate of substitution indicates how much the price can be lowered for an extra unit of sale while keeping the profit constant. This is therefore the slope of the isoprofit curve.
Points A and C are on the same isoprofit curve. Therefore the firm would be indifferent between the two.
The marketing department determines the price after HR determines the wage level.
The profit-maximizing point is B, in which the firm produces more and charges less than at point C.
