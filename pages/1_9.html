1.8 The gains from specialization
Capitalism and specialization
Look around at the objects in your workspace. Do you know the person who made them? What about your clothing? Or anything else in sight from where you are sitting?
Now imagine that it is 1776, the year that Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations. The same questions, asked anywhere in the world, would have had a different answer.
At that time many families produced a wide array of goods for their own use, including crops, meat, clothing, even tools. Many of the things that you might have spotted in Adam Smiths day would have been made by a member of the family, or of the village. You would have made some objects yourself; others would have been made locally and purchased from the village market.

economies of scaleThese occur when doubling all of the inputs to a production process more than doubles the output. The shape of a firms long-run average cost curve depends both on returns to scale in production and the effect of scale on the prices it pays for its inputs. Also known as: increasing returns to scale. See also: diseconomies of scale.

One of the changes that was underway during Adam Smiths life, but has greatly accelerated since, is specialization in the production of goods and services. As Smith explained, we become better at producing things when we each focus on a limited range of activities. This is true for three reasons:

Learning by doing: We acquire skills as we produce things.
Difference in ability: For reasons of skill, or natural surroundings such as the quality of the soil, some people are better at producing some things than others.
economies of scale: Producing a large number of units of some good is often more cost-effective than producing a smaller number. We investigate this in more detail in Unit 7.

These are the advantages of working on a limited number of tasks or products. People do not typically produce the full range of goods and services that they use or consume in their daily life. Instead we specialize, some producing one good, others producing other goods, some working as welders, others as teachers or farmers.
But people will not specialize unless they have a way to acquire the other goods they need.
For this reason, specializationcalled the division of labourposes a problem for society: how are the goods and services to be distributed from the producer to the final user? In the course of history, this has happened in a number of distinct ways, from direct government requisitioning and distribution as was done in the US and many economies during the Second World War, to gifts and voluntary sharing as we do in families today and as practiced among even unrelated members of a community by our hunting and gathering ancestors. Capitalism enhanced our opportunities for specialization by expanding the economic importance of both markets and firms.
Specialization exists within governments and also in families, where who does which household chore is often associated with age and gender. Here we look at the division of labour in firms and in markets.
The division of labour in firms
Adam Smith begins The Wealth of Nations with the following sentence:

The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.

He went on to describe a pin factory in which the specialization of tasks among the working men allowed a level of productivitypins produced per daythat seemed to him extraordinary. Firms may employ thousands or even hundreds of thousands of individuals, most of them working at specialized tasks under the direction of the owners or manager of the firm.
This description of the firm stresses its hierarchical nature from top to bottom. But you can also think of the firm as a means by which large numbers of people, each with distinct skills and capacities, contribute to a common outcome, the product. The firm thus facilitates a kind of cooperation among specialized producers that increases productivity.
We return to the question of who does what within the firm and why in Unit6.
Markets, specialization, and comparative advantage
Chapter 3 in The Wealth of Nations is titled: That the Division of Labour is Limited by the Extent of the Market, in which Smith explains:

When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other mens labour as he has occasion for.

When you hear the word market what word do you think of? Competition probably is what came to mind. And you would be right to associate the two words.
But you might have also come up with cooperation. Why? Because markets allow each of us pursuing our private objectives to work together, producing and distributing goods and services in a way that, while far from perfect, is in many cases better than the alternatives.
Markets accomplish an extraordinary result: unintended cooperation on a global scale. The people who produced the phone on your desk did not know or care about you; they produced it rather than you because they are better at producing phones than you are, and you ended up with it because you paid them, allowing them to buy goods that they need, also produced by total strangers to them.
A simple example illustrates how, when people differ in their ability to produce different goods, markets allow them to specialize. It shows something surprising: all producers can benefit by specializing and trading goods, even when this means that one producer specializes in a good that another could produce at lower cost.
Imagine a world of just two individuals (Greta and Carlos) who each need both of two goods, apples and wheat, to survive. They differ in how productive they are in growing apples and wheat. If Greta spent all her time, say, 2,000 hours in a year, producing apples, she would produce 1,250. If she only produced wheat, she would produce 50 tonnes per annum. Carlos has less fertile land than Greta for producing both crops: if he devoted all his time (the same amount as Greta) to apple growing, he would produce 1,000 per year, and if he produced only wheat he would produce 20 tonnes. See Figure 1.9a for a summary.

Absolute and comparative advantage in the production of apples and wheat.
        





absolute advantageA person or country has this in the production of a good if the inputs it uses to produce this good are less than in some other person or country. See also: comparative advantage.

Although Carlos land is worse for producing both crops, his disadvantage is less, relative to Greta, in apples than in wheat. Greta can produce two and a half times more wheat as he can but only 25% more apples.
Economists distinguish who is better at producing what in two ways: absolute advantage and comparative advantage.
Greta has an absolute advantage in both crops. Carlos has an absolute disadvantage. She can produce more of either crop than he can.

comparative advantageA person or country has comparative advantage in the production of a particular good, if the cost of producing an additional unit of that good relative to the cost of producing another good is lower than another person or countrys cost to produce the same two goods. See also: absolute advantage.

Greta has a comparative advantage in wheat; Carlos has a comparative advantage in apples. Although she is better, Carlos is least disadvantaged in producing apples. Greta has a comparative advantage in producing wheat.
Initially, Carlos and Greta are not able to trade with each other. Both must be self-sufficient, consuming exactly what they produce, so they will each produce both goods in order to survive. Greta chooses to use 40% of her time in apple production, and the rest producing wheat. Column 1 of Figure 1.9b shows that she produces and consumes 500 apples and 30 tonnes of wheat. Carlos consumption is also shown: he spends 30% of his time producing apples, and 70% producing wheat.
Now suppose that there are markets where apples and wheat may be bought and sold, and that 40 apples can be bought for the price of 1 tonne of wheat. If Greta specializes in growing wheat only, producing 50 tonnes of wheat and no apples, while Carlos specializes in apples, total production of both crops will be higher than it was under self-sufficiency (column 2). Then they can each sell some of their own crop in the market, and buy some of the good that the other produced.
For example, if Greta sells 15 tonnes of wheat (column 3) in order to buy 600 apples, she can now consume more apples and more wheat than before (column 4). And the table shows that buying the 15 tonnes of wheat produced by Greta, in return for 600 apples, similarly enables Carlos to consume more of both goods than was possible in the absence of specialization and trade.

Figure 1.9b 
Comparing self-sufficiency and specialization. Under self-sufficiency, both consume exactly what they produce. Under complete specialization, Greta produces only wheat; Carlos produces only apples; and they trade the surplus of their production above what they consume.
        




In constructing this example we assumed market prices are such that a tonne of wheat could be exchanged for 40 apples. We will return to how markets work in Units 7 to 12, but Exercise 1.10 shows that this assumption was not critical. There are other prices at which both Greta and Carlos would benefit from trading with each other.
The opportunity to tradethat is, the existence of an apple market and a wheat markethas benefited both Greta and Carlos. This was possible because specializing in the production of a single good increased the total amount of each good produced, from 800 to 1,000 apples and from 44 to 50 tonnes of wheat. The surprising thing mentioned above is that Greta ended up buying 600 apples from Carlos even though she could have produced those apples at a lower cost herself (in terms of labour time). This was a better way to spend their time because while Greta had an absolute advantage in producing both goods, Carlos had a comparative advantage in producing apples.
Markets contribute to increasing the productivity of labourand can therefore help to explain the hockey stick of historyby allowing people to specialize in the production of goods for which they have a comparative advantage, that is the things at which they arerelatively speakingleast bad!

Exercise 1.10 Apples and wheat
Suppose that market prices were such that 35 apples could be bought for 1 tonne of wheat.

If Greta sold 16 tonnes of wheat, would both she and Carlos still be better off?
What would happen if only 20 apples could be bought for the price of a tonne of wheat?
