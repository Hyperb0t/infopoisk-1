21.7 Optimal patents: Balancing the objectives of invention and diffusion
Patents confront us with an economic problem: how best to balance the competing objectives of making good use of existing knowledge, devoting sufficient economic resources and creativity to producing new knowledge, and diffusing the new knowledge that is created. An optimal patent is one that best advances the use of knowledge in the economy. Currently, agreements administered by the World Trade Organization, which regulates international trade, may prevent countries from choosing patent length, but given complete freedom of choice, how could a policymaker decide the optimal patent length?
In Figure 21.13, we look first at the decision of an innovator in the upper panel. Work through the analysis in Figure 21.13 to understand the timing of costs and benefits of innovation and who receives them.












Figure 21.13 
Costs and rents associated with innovation for the inventor and others.
        















The innovator incurs costs


The costs of innovation are shown by the red rectangle.














The innovation is successful


The firm makes innovation rents above economic profits. This is the rectangle above the dotted zero economic profits line.














A patent


The firm benefits from innovation rents for the life of the patent.














The benefits to others in the economy


The lower panel shows the benefits that arise from the innovation. If the innovation did not exist, there would be no benefits to others.














A patent


The patent reduces benefits to others, because it delays copying and diffusion.




In the lower panel of Figure 21.13, we include the benefits to others in the economy that arise from the innovation. The term patent cliff is from the point of view of the innovator, and refers to the significant decrease in profits when the patent expires. But in the lower panel we see the opposite effectthe benefits of the innovation shoot up when the patent expires, because the innovation is now free to diffuse throughout the economy.
This demonstrates the trade-off. Without the innovation, there are no benefits to others and the likelihood of the innovation increases with longer patents. However, for any given innovation, the benefits are reduced by the duration of the patent. Earlier imitation of the innovation brings benefits to the economy, shown by the dashed rectangle in the lower panel.
From this, we can see that a long patent emphasizes the benefits of rapid innovation, and a short patent emphasizes the benefits of rapid imitation. But we cant decide by looking at Figure 21.13 how long the optimal patent should be.
The trade-off between the benefits of diffusion and of invention

isototal benefits curveThe combinations of the probability of innovation and the total benefits to society from a firms innovation that yield the same total benefits.

Figure 21.14 shows how we can represent the benefits of innovation to society as a whole. On the horizontal axis are shown the total benefits to others in the economy if the firm innovates. This is called B. On the vertical axis we estimate the probability of innovation, called pI. The downward-sloping curves are indifference curves called isototal benefits curves. The total benefits to others from innovation are:

Isototal benefits curves: The trade-off between the benefits of invention and diffusion.
        















The isototal benefits curve


The downward-sloping curve is an indifference curve, called an isototal benefits curve. Along the curve the total benefits arising from an innovation are equal to pIB and remain constant.














Rectangles that touch the curve


Any rectangle with a corner on the curve has the same area as any other. Points C and D illustrate this.














A preferable curve


The higher isototal benefits curve is preferable to the curve through C and D.




Feasible invention and diffusion
What are the constraints? What limits the total benefits that will occur if the innovation takes place? This will depend on the length of the patent, because a longer period of patent protection is thought at least initially to increase the probability of innovation, pI, but to reduce the amount of total benefits for others, B, if the innovation occurs because of the delay in copying.
Even when there is no patent, innovation can occur, as shown on the vertical axis of Figure 21.15. In these cases the innovator could capture innovation rents just by being the first in the market, because it takes competitors some time to catch up.
Figure 21.15 shows that as the duration of patents increases (moving to the right along the horizontal axis), so does the probability of innovation because innovation rents are protected for a longer period of time. Beyond a particular length of patent protection, however, the probability of innovation begins to decline because long-term patents will prevent other potential innovators from using protected knowledge or processes to develop an idea.

Patent duration and probability of innovation.
        




We can show the feasible set in Figure 21.16, which presents the trade-off between a higher probability of innovation and the total benefits to others if the firm innovates.











Figure 21.16 
The feasible set: Innovation probability and benefits to others.
        




Each point on the feasible set is the result of a given patent length, starting at the left-hand side with a patent that never expires. As we move to the right, the duration of a patent declines. There are increasing benefits to others. Initially this increases both the benefits to others should the innovation occur, and (as we saw in Figure 21.15) the probability of innovation. This gives the positively sloped section of the feasible set. However, as we have also seen, at some point there will be a trade-off: a further reduction in patent duration will decrease the probability of innovation, even though it expands the total benefits that would result should the innovation occur. This explains the downward-sloping portion of the frontier of the feasible set.
Optimal patent duration
If we now put the feasible set together with the isototal benefits curves, we can determine the length of the patent that maximizes the expected benefits consistent with the constraints imposed by the trade-off between the incentive for innovation and stimulating diffusion. The highest attainable level of total benefits is shown by the tangency of the isototal benefits curve with the feasible set. This is point A in Figure 21.17.

The optimal probability of innovation for society.
        















Maximizing expected benefits to society


Combining the feasible set with the isototal benefits curves, we can determine the length of the patent that maximizes the expected benefits to society as a whole.














The highest attainable level of total benefits


This is shown by the tangency of the isototal benefits curve with the feasible set at point A.














The optimal probability of innovation


From the perspective of society as a whole, the optimal probability of innovation is p*.














Higher probability of innovation but lower benefits to society


At E, with a longer patent than the optimal one at A, innovation is more likely but because of less diffusion, its benefits to society as a whole are lower as shown by the lower isototal benefits curve.




This outcome on its own is not a policy, but it allows us to determine one. We can now go back to Figure 21.15 and ask what patent duration would a policymaker set so that the innovating firm will choose societys optimal probability of innovation, p*? Figure 21.18 shows the answer.












Figure 21.18 
The optimal patent duration.
        















The optimal probability of innovation


Given the benefits of innovation to others, we established in Figure 21.17 that p* is the optimal probability of innovation. This can tell us what the duration of the patents should be.














The optimal duration of patents


If we know p*, we can use Figure 21.15 (the right-hand figure here) to determine the optimal duration of patents, d*.














What if there were no patents?


We can see that innovation will still occur, but below the optimal level for society.





Exercise 21.13 Optimal patents

Consider two contrasting technologies. For one, the government would optimally choose a short patent duration. For the other, it would choose a longer patent duration. In each case, draw the feasible set and label the optimal point, as in Figure 21.17. Assume the same isototal benefits curves.
The length of patents and copyrights has increased steadily since the Industrial Revolution. Explain why this may have happened, and discuss whether this could be a good or a bad thing.
How should patent offices react if firms seek to cement patent monopolies by patenting improved versions of the original technology at a later date? (This is a process known as evergreeningits described in the Journal of Health Economics by C. Scott Hemphill and Bhaven N. Sampat.)



Question 21.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 21.13 depicts the costs and rents associated with innovation for the inventor and others.
Based on this diagram, which of the following statements is correct?

When there is no patent, the innovation is copied immediately.
At the point that the patent expires, the patent owner falls off a patent cliff where they lose innovation rents.
There is zero benefit to others from the innovation during the patent period.
The innovators benefit from the patent outweighs the lost benefits to the others.


The diagram shows that there is a period during which innovation is not copied despite an absence of patent, allowing the innovator to recover some (or all) of the cost of innovation.
As shown in the figure, profits of the patent owner return to zero economic profits once the patent expires.
The diagram shows a small but positive benefit to others during the patent period.
In terms of the size of the area, the benefits lost to the others is shown to be much larger than the benefit gained by the innovator.



Question 21.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following diagram depicts the probability of innovation as the duration of patents is increased.












Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

There is no innovation in the absence of patents.
Longer patent duration will always lead to an increase in the probability of innovation.
The downward sloping part of the graph demonstrates the trade-off between greater incentive to innovate from higher innovation rent income and the disincentive for potential innovators from using patented knowledge.
The optimal duration of patents is where the probability of innovation is maximized.


The positive intercept on the vertical axis implies that innovation occurs even in the absence of patents.
Evidently not, as the diagram shows. At some point, the longer-term patents will impede potential innovators from using already patented knowledge for further innovation.
True. The curve slopes downwards because these two effects work in opposite directions. At points to the right of the maximum, the disincentive to innovation because patents prevent the knowledge being used by other innovators outweighs the positive incentive effect from increased innovation rents.
The optimal duration of patents depends on the probability of innovation, as well as the total benefits to others from innovation if it occurs (which is decreasing in the duration of patents). Therefore the optimal duration occurs to the left of the maximum probability point.
