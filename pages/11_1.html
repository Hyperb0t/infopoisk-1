Rent-seeking explains why prices change (and why sometimes they dont), and how markets work (sometimes for better, sometimes for worse)

Prices are messages about conditions in the economy, and provide motivation for acting on this information.
People take advantage of rent-seeking opportunities when competitive markets are not in equilibrium, often profiting by setting a price different from what others are setting.
This rent-seeking process may eventually equate supply to demand.
Prices in financial markets are determined through trading mechanisms and can change from minute to minute in response to new information and changing beliefs.
Price bubbles can occur, for example in markets for financial assets.
Governments and firms sometimes set prices and adopt other policies such that markets do not clear.
Economic rents help explain how markets work.

Fish and fishing are a major part of the life of the people of Kerala in India. Most of them eat fish at least once a day, and more than a million people are involved in the fishing industry. But before 1997, prices were high and fishing profits were limited due to a combination of waste and the bargaining power of fish merchants, who purchased the fishermens catch and sold it to consumers.
When returning to port to sell their daily catch of sardines to the fish merchants, many fishermen found that the merchants already had as many fish as they needed that day. They would be forced to dump their worthless catch back into the sea. A lucky few returned to the right port at the right time when demand exceeded supply, and they were rewarded by extraordinarily high prices.
On 14 January 1997, for example, 11 boatloads of fish brought to the market at the town of Badagara found the market oversupplied, and jettisoned their catch. There was excess supply of 11 boatloads. But at fish markets within 15 km of Badagara there was excess demand: 15 buyers left the Chombala market unable to purchase fish at any price. The luck, or lack of it, of fishermen returning to the ports along the Kerala coast is illustrated in Figure 11.1.

law of one priceHolds when a good is traded at the same price across all buyers and sellers. If a good were sold at different prices in different places, a trader could buy it cheaply in one place and sell it at a higher price in another. See also: arbitrage.

Only seven of the 15 markets did not suffer either from over- or under-supply. In these seven villages (on the vertical line) prices ranged from Rs4 per kg to more than Rs7 per kg. This is an example of how the law of one pricea characteristic of a competitive market equilibriumis sometimes a poor guide to how actual markets function.

When the fishermen have bargaining power because there is excess demand, they get much higher prices. In markets with neither excess demand nor excess supply, the average price was Rs5.9 per kg, shown by the horizontal dashed line. In markets with excess demand, the average was Rs9.3 per kg. The fishermen fortunate enough to put in at these markets obtained extraordinary profits, if we assume that the price in markets with neither excess demand nor supply was high enough to yield economic profits. Of course, on the following day they may have been the unlucky ones who found no buyers at all, and so would dump their catch into the sea.
This all changed when the fishermen got mobile phones. While still at sea, the returning fishermen would phone the beach fish markets and pick the one at which the prices that day were highest. If they returned to a high-priced market they would earn an economic rent (that is, income in excess of their next best alternative, which would be returning to a market with no excess demand or even one with excess supply).
By gaining access to real-time market information on relative prices for fish, the fishermen could adjust their pattern of production (fishing) and distribution (the market they visit) to secure the highest returns.
A study of 15 beach markets along 225 km of the northern Kerala coast found that, once the fishermen used mobile phones, differences in daily prices among the beach markets were cut to a quarter of their previous levels. No boats jettisoned their catches. Reduced waste and the elimination of the dealers bargaining power raised the profits of fishermen by 8% at the same time as consumer prices fell by 4%.
Mobile phones allowed the fishermen to become very effective rent-seekers, and their rent-seeking activities changed how Keralas fish markets worked: they came close to implementing the law of one price, virtually eliminating the periodic excess demand and supply, to the benefit of fishermen and consumers (but not of the fish dealers who had acted as middlemen).
This happened because the Kerala sardine fishermen could respond to the information given by the prices at different beaches. It is another example of the idea we introduced in Unit 8 to explain the effect of the American Civil War on markets for cotton: that prices can be messages. For the economist Friedrich Hayek, this was the key to understanding markets.

Great economists Friedrich Hayek

The Great Depression of the 1930s ravaged the capitalist economies of Europe and North America, throwing a quarter of the workforce out of work in the US. During the same period, the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union continued to grow rapidly under a succession of five-year plans. Even the arch-opponent of socialism, Joseph Schumpeter, had conceded:
Can socialism work? Of course it can There is nothing wrong with the pure theory of socialism.
Friedrich Hayek (18991992) disagreed. Born in Vienna, he was an Austrian (later British) economist and philosopher who believed that the government should play a minimal role in the running of society. He was against any efforts to redistribute income in the name of social justice. He was also an opponent of the policies advocated by John Maynard Keynes designed to moderate the instability of the economy and the insecurity of employment.
Hayeks book The Road to Serfdom was written against the backdrop of the Second World War, when economic planning was being used both by German and Japanese fascist governments, by the Soviet communist authorities, and by the British and American governments. He argued that well-intentioned planning would inevitably lead to a totalitarian outcome.1
His key idea about economics revolutionized how economists think about markets. It was that prices are messages. They convey valuable information about how scarce a good is, but information that is available only if prices are free to be determined by supply and demand, rather than by the decisions of planners. Hayek even wrote a comic book, which was distributed by General Motors, to explain how this mechanism was superior to planning.
But Hayek did not think much of the theory of competitive equilibrium that we explained in Unit 8, in which all buyers and sellers are price-takers. The modern theory of competitive equilibrium, he wrote, assumes the situation to exist which a true explanation ought to account for as the effect of the competitive process.
In Hayeks view, assuming a state of equilibrium (as Walras had done in developing general equilibrium theory) prevents us from analysing competition seriously. He defined competition as the action of endeavouring to gain what another endeavours to gain at the same time. Hayek explained:

Now, how many of the devices adopted in ordinary life to that end would still be open to a seller in a market in which so-called perfect competition prevails? I believe that the answer is exactly none. Advertising, undercutting, and improving (differentiating) the goods or services produced are all excluded by definitionperfect competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities. (The Meaning of Competition, 1946)

The advantage of capitalism, to Hayek, is that it provides the right information to the right people. In 1945, he wrote:

Which of these systems [central planning or competition] is likely to be more efficient depends mainly on the question under which of them we can expect [to make fuller use] of the existing knowledge. This, in turn, depends on whether we are more likely to succeed in putting at the disposal of a single central authority all the knowledge which ought to be used but which is initially dispersed among many different individuals, or in conveying to the individuals such additional knowledge as they need in order to enable them to dovetail their plans with those of others. (The Use of Knowledge in Society, 1945)

Hayeks challenging ideas, and their application, are still fiercely debated today.2

Unit 8 introduced the concept of competitive market equilibrium, a situation in which the actions of the buyers and sellers of a good have no tendency to change its price, or the quantity traded, and the market clears. We saw that changes from the outside called exogenous shocks, like an increase in the demand for bread or a new tax, will alter the equilibrium price and quantity.
The opposite of exogenous is endogenous, meaning coming from the inside and resulting from the workings of the model itself. In this unit, we will study how prices and quantities change through endogenous responses to exogenous shocks and the real-world competition that Hayek complained was absent from the model of competitive equilibrium. We will see that rent-seeking behaviour by market participants can bring about market clearing, move markets to different equilibria in the long run, cause bubbles and crashes, or lead to the development of secondary markets in response to price controls.

Question 11.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 11.1 shows how bargaining power affected prices in Kerala beach markets on 14 January 1997. Based on this information, what can we conclude?

The higher the excess supply, the lower the price of fish.
The price of fish in all markets with excess demand is 9.3.
The data satisfy the law of one price.
The data demonstrate that buyers have bargaining power when there is excess supply.


The price of fish is zero in all markets with excess supply.
The average price in the markets with excess demand is 9.3, but the higher the excess demand, the higher the price.
The law of one price is not satisfied because fish are sold at different prices in different places.
When there is excess supply, the price is zero. The buyers have all the bargaining power while sellers have none.
