4.5 Altruistic preferences in the prisoners dilemma
When Anil and Bala wanted to get rid of pests (Section 4.3), they found themselves in a prisoners dilemma. One reason for the unfortunate outcome was that they did not account for the costs that their actions inflicted on the other. The choice of pest control regime using the insecticide implied a free ride on the other farmers contribution to ensuring clean water.
If Anil cares about Balas wellbeing as well as his own, the outcome can be different.
In Figure 4.6 the two axes now represent Anil and Balas payoffs. Just as with the example of the lottery, the diagram shows the feasible outcomes. However, in this case the feasible set has only four points. We have shortened the names of the strategies for convenience: Terminator is T, IPC is I. Notice that movements upward and to the right from (T, T) to (I, I) are win-win: both get higher payoffs. On the other hand, moving up, and to the left, or down, and to the rightfrom (I, T) to (T, I) or the reverseare win-lose changes. Win-lose means that Bala gets a higher payoff at the expense of Anil, or Anil benefits at the expense of Bala.
As in the case of dividing lottery winnings, we look at two cases. If Anil does not care about Balas wellbeing, his indifference curves are vertical lines. If he does care, he has downward-sloping indifference curves. Work through Figure 4.6 to see what will happen in each case.












Figure 4.6 
Anils decision to use IPC (I) or Terminator (T) as his crop management strategy depends on whether he is completely selfish or somewhat altruistic.
        















Anil and Balas payoffs


The two axes in the figure represent Anil and Balas payoffs. The four points are the feasible outcomes associated to the strategies.














Anils indifference curves if he doesnt care about Bala


If Anil does not care about Balas wellbeing, his indifference curves are vertical, so (T, I) is his most preferred outcome. He prefers (T, I) to (I, I), so should choose T if Bala chooses I. If Anil is completely selfish, T is unambiguously his best choice.














Anils indifference curves when he cares about Bala


When Anil cares about Balas wellbeing, indifference curves are downward-sloping and (I, I) is his most preferred outcome. If Bala chooses I, Anil should choose I. Anil should also choose I if Bala chooses T, since he prefers (I, T) to (T, T).




Figure 4.6 demonstrates that when Anil is completely self-interested, his dominant strategy is Terminator (as we saw before). But if Anil cares sufficiently about Bala, his dominant strategy is IPC. If Bala feels the same way, then the two would both choose IPC, resulting in the outcome that both of them prefer the most.
The main lesson is that if people care about one another, social dilemmas are easier to resolve. This helps us understand the historical examples in which people mutually cooperate for irrigation or enforce the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, rather than free riding on the cooperation of others.

Question 4.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 4.6 shows Anils preferences when he is completely selfish, and also when he is somewhat altruistic, when he and Bala participate in the prisoners dilemma game.
Based on the graph, we can say that:

When Anil is completely selfish, using Terminator is his dominant strategy.
When Anil is somewhat altruistic, using Terminator is his dominant strategy.
When Anil is completely selfish, (T, T) is the dominant strategy equilibrium even though it is on a lower indifference curve for him than (T, I).
If Anil is somewhat altruistic, and Balas preferences are the same as Anils, (I, I) is attained as the dominant strategy equilibrium.


(T, I) is on a higher vertical indifference curve than (I, I) (that is, it is further to the right) and (T, T) is on a higher vertical indifference curve that (I, T). So using Terminator is a dominant strategy for Anil when he is completely selfish.
When Anil is somewhat altruistic, (I, I) is on a higher indifference curve than (T, I), and (I, T) is on a higher indifference curve than (T, T). So using IPC is Anils dominant strategy.
Terminator is a dominant strategy for both players, so (T, T) is a dominant strategy equilibrium. Anil would prefer (T, I) but Bala will never choose IPC.
IPC is a dominant strategy for Anil when he is somewhat altruistic. If Bala has the same preferences IPC will be a dominant strategy for him too, so (I, I) is the dominant strategy equilibrium.



Exercise 4.4 Amoral self-interest
Imagine a society in which everyone was entirely self-interested (cared only about his or her own wealth) and amoral (followed no ethical rules that would interfere with gaining that wealth). How would that society be different from the society you live in? Consider the following:

families
workplaces
neighbourhoods
traffic
political activity (would people vote?)


Inequality
