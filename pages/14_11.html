14.10 Aggregate demand and unemployment

supply side (aggregate economy)How labour and capital are used to produce goods and services. It uses the labour market model (also referred to as the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve model). See also: demand side (aggregate economy).demand side (aggregate economy)How spending decisions generate demand for goods and services, and as a result, employment and output. It uses the multiplier model. See also: supply side (aggregate economy).multiplier modelA model of aggregate demand that includes the multiplier process. See also: fiscal multiplier, multiplier process.

We now have two models for thinking about total output, employment, and the unemployment rate in the economy:

The supply side (labour market) model: One model, set out in Unit 9, is of the supply side of the economy and focuses on how labour is employed to produce goods and services. This is called the labour market model (or the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve model).
The demand side (multiplier) model: The other is of the demand side of the economy and explains how spending decisions generate demand for goods and services and, as a result, employment and output. This is the multiplier model.

When we put the models together, we will be able to explain how the economy fluctuates around the long-run labour market equilibrium over the business cycle.
The labour market model from Unit 9 is shown in Figure 14.17, and the equilibrium in the labour market is where the wage- and price-setting curves intersect. We will see that the economy tends to fluctuate over the business cycle around the unemployment rate shown at point A. In the example in Figure 14.17, the unemployment rate at equilibrium is 5%.

production functionA graphical or mathematical expression describing the amount of output that can be produced by any given amount or combination of input(s). The function describes differing technologies capable of producing the same thing.cyclical unemploymentThe increase in unemployment above equilibrium unemployment caused by a fall in aggregate demand associated with the business cycle. Also known as: demand-deficient unemployment. See also: equilibrium unemployment.short run (model)The term does not refer to a period of time, but instead to what is exogenous: prices, wages, the capital stock, technology, institutions. See also: wages, capital, technology, institutions, medium run (model), long run (model).

Figure 14.18 places the multiplier diagram beneath the labour market diagram. Note that in the labour market diagram, the horizontal axis measures the number of workers, so we can measure employment and unemployment along it. In the multiplier diagram, output is on the horizontal axis. The production function connects employment and output, and in this model, the production function is very simple.
We assume that labour productivity is constant and equal to  (lambda), so the production function is:

To allow us to draw the demand-side model underneath the supply-side model, we assume  = 1, and so Y = N.

Short-term fluctuations in employment are caused by changes in aggregate demand. As we saw in Unit 9, when employment is below the labour market equilibrium because of deficient aggregate demand, the additional unemployment is called cyclical unemployment. If there is excess demand, above labour market equilibrium, then unemployment is below its equilibrium level.
In Figure 14.19, the economy is initially at labour market equilibrium at point A with unemployment of 5%. The level of output here is called the normal level of output. This means that the level of aggregate demand must be as shown by the aggregate demand curve labelled normal. Any other level of aggregate demand would produce a different level of employment.

Labour market equilibrium


The economy is initially at labour market equilibrium at point A with unemployment of 5%. The level of aggregate demand must be as shown by the aggregate demand curve labelled normal.














A boom


Consider a rise in investment that shifts the aggregate demand curve up to AD (high), so that output and employment rise. The economy is at B: with the boom, unemployment falls below 5%. The additional employment is called cyclical employment.














A slump


If the aggregate demand curve shifts down, then through the multiplier process, output and employment fall to C. Unemployment rises above 5%. The additional unemployment is called cyclical unemployment.




In our study of business cycle fluctuations using the multiplier model, we have made a number of ceteris paribus assumptions. We have assumed that prices, wages, the capital stock, technology, and institutions are constant. We use the term short run to refer to these assumptions. The purpose of the model is to predict what happens to output, aggregate demand, and employment when there is a demand shock (a shock to investment, consumption or exports), or when policymakers use fiscal policy or monetary policy to shift the aggregate demand curve.

medium run (model)The term does not refer to a period of time, but instead to what is exogenous. In this case capital stock, technology, and institutions are exogenous. Output, employment, prices, and wages are endogenous. See also: capital goods, technology, institution, short run (model), long run (model).

Notice that in Figure 14.19, the labour market is not in equilibrium when output is higher or lower than normal. The labour market model is a medium-run model where wages and prices can change, unlike in the multiplier model, which is a short-run model. So a short-run equilibrium in the multiplier model may not be a medium-run equilibrium in the labour market model.

long run (model)The term does not refer to a period of time, but instead to what is exogenous. A long-run cost curve, for example, refers to costs when the firm can fully adjust all of the inputs including its capital goods; but technology and the economys institutions are exogenous. See also: technology, institutions, short run (model), medium run (model).


In Unit 15, the business cycle: We develop the model in Figure 14.19 by asking what happens to wages and prices in a boom and in a recession.
In Unit 16, the long run: We use the wage-setting curve and the price-setting curves to study the long run, where output, employment, prices and wages can change, as well as institutions and technologies. We ask how changes in basic institutions and policies such as the weakening of trade unions, the increase in competition in markets for goods and services, or new labour-saving technologies will affect the aggregate economy.

The table in Figure 14.20 summarizes the different models we will use to study the aggregate economy.

Question 14.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following are the labour market and the multiplier diagrams, representing the medium-run supply side and the short-run demand side of the aggregate economy, respectively:












Assume that the economys production function is given by Y = N, where Y is the output and N is the employment. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

A rise in investment shifts the AD curve up, resulting in a higher aggregate output. This causes the price-setting curve to shift up in the short run, leading to higher employment.
A fall in autonomous consumption shifts the AD curve down, resulting in a lower aggregate output. This causes the wage-setting curve to shift to the left in the short run, leading to higher unemployment.
Labour productivity shifts with the changes in aggregate demand in the short run.
The shifts in the aggregate demand cause short-run cyclical fluctuations in unemployment around the medium-run level shown in the labour market diagram.


In the short-run there is no shift in the price- or wage-setting curves. Instead, there are cyclical fluctuations in unemployment away from the medium-run level.
In the short-run there is no shift in the price or wage-setting curves. Instead, there are cyclical fluctuations in unemployment away from the medium-run level.
Labour productivity is assumed constant in the short-run.
The labour market model determines the medium-run equilibrium while the aggregate demand model determines the short-run equilibrium.
