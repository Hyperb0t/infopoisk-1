8.3 Price-taking firms
In the second-hand textbook example, both buyers and sellers are individual consumers. Now we look at markets where the sellers are firms. We know from Unit 7 how firms choose their price and quantity when producing differentiated goods, and we saw that if other firms made similar products, their choice of price would be restricted (the demand curve for their own product would be almost flat) because raising the price would cause consumers to switch to other similar brands.
If there are many firms producing identical products, and consumers can easily switch from one firm to another, then firms will be price-takers in equilibrium. They will be unable to benefit from attempting to trade at a price different from the prevailing price.
To see how price-taking firms behave, consider a city where many small bakeries produce bread and sell it direct to consumers. Figure 8.4 shows what the market demand curve (the total daily demand for bread of all consumers in the city) might look like. It is downward-sloping as usual because at higher prices, fewer consumers will be willing to buy.











The market demand curve for bread.

Suppose that you are the owner of one small bakery. You have to decide what price to charge and how many loaves to produce each morning. Suppose that neighbouring bakeries are selling loaves identical to yours at 2.35. This is the prevailing market price, and you will not be able to sell loaves at a higher price than other bakeries, because no one would buyyou are a price-taker.
Your marginal costs increase with your output of bread. When the quantity is small, the marginal cost is low, close to 1: having installed mixers, ovens and other equipment, and employed a baker, the additional cost to produce a loaf of bread is relatively small, but the average cost of a loaf is high. As the number of loaves per day increases, the average cost falls, but marginal costs begin to rise gradually because you have to employ extra staff and use equipment more intensively. At higher quantities the marginal cost is above the average cost; then average costs rise again.
The marginal and average cost curves are drawn in Figure 8.5. As in Unit 7, costs include the opportunity cost of capital. If price were equal to average cost (P = AC), your economic profit would be zero. You, the owner, would obtain a normal return on your capital. So the average cost curve (the leftmost curve in Figure 8.5) is the zero-economic-profit curve. The isoprofit curves show price and quantity combinations at which you would receive higher levels of profit. As we explained in Unit 7, isoprofit curves slope downwards where price is above marginal cost, and upwards where price is below marginal cost, so the marginal cost curve passes through the lowest point on each isoprofit curve. If price is above marginal cost, total profits can remain unchanged only if a larger quantity is sold for a lower price. Similarly, if price is below marginal cost, total profits can remain unchanged only if a larger quantity is sold for a higher price.
Figure 8.5 demonstrates how to make your decision. Like the firms in Unit 7, you face a constrained optimization problem. You want to find the point of maximum profit in your feasible set.

Marginal cost and isoprofit curves


The bakery has an increasing MC curve. On the AC curve, profit is zero. When MC > AC, the AC curve slopes upward. The other isoprofit curves represent higher levels of profit, and MC passes through the lowest points of all the isoprofit curves.














Price-taking


The bakery is a price-taker. The market price is P* = 2.35. If you choose a higher price, customers will go to other bakeries. Your feasible set of prices and quantities is the area below the horizontal line at P*.














The profit-maximizing price


The point of highest profit in the feasible set is point A, where the 80 isoprofit curve is tangent to the feasible set. You should make 120 loaves per day, and sell them at the market price, 2.35 each. You will make 80 of profit per day in addition to normal profits.














The profit-maximizing quantity


Your profit-maximizing quantity, Q*=120, is found at the point where P*=MC: the marginal cost of the 120th loaf is equal to the market price.




Because you are a price-taker, the feasible set is all points where price is less than or equal to 2.35, the market price. Your optimal choice is P*=2.35 and Q* = 120, where the isoprofit curve is tangent to the feasible set. The problem looks similar to the one for Beautiful Cars in Unit7, except that for a price-taker, the demand curve is completely flat. For your bakery, it is not the market demand curve in Figure 8.4 that affects your own demand, it is the price charged by your competitors. This is why the horizontal line at P* in Figure 8.5 is labelled as the firms demand curve. If you charge more than P*, your demand will be zero, but at P* or less you can sell as many loaves as you like.
Figure 8.5 illustrates a very important characteristic of price-taking firms. They choose to produce a quantity at which the marginal cost is equal to the market price (MC = P*). This is always true. For a price-taking firm, the demand curve for its own output is a horizontal line at the market price, so maximum profit is achieved at a point on the demand curve where the isoprofit curve is horizontal. And we know from Unit 7 that where isoprofit curves are horizontal, the price is equal to the marginal cost.
Another way to understand why a price-taking firm produces at the level of output where MC = P* is to think about what would happen to its profits if it deviated from this point. If the firm were to increase output to a level where MC > P*, the last unit would cost more than P* to make, so the firm would make a loss on this unit and could make higher profits by reducing output. If it were to produce where MC < P*, it could produce at least one more unit and sell it at a profit. Therefore it should raise output as far as the point where MC = P*. This is where profits are maximized.

Price-taking firm
A price-taking firm maximizes profit by choosing a quantity where the marginal cost is equal to the market price (MC = P*) and selling at the market price P*.

This is an important result that you should remember, but you need to be careful with it. When we make statements like for a price-taking firm, price equals marginal cost, we do not mean that the firm chooses a price equal to its marginal cost. Instead, we mean the opposite: the firm accepts the market price, and chooses its quantity so that the marginal cost is equal to that price.
Put yourself in the position of the bakery owner again. What would you do if the market price changed? Figure 8.6 demonstrates that as prices change you would choose different points on the marginal cost curve.













The firms supply curve.

A change in price


When the market price is 2.35, you supply 120 loaves. What would you do if the price changed?














If the price rises


If P* were to rise to 3.20, you could reach a higher isoprofit curve. To maximize profit you should produce 163 loaves per day.














If the price falls


If the price falls to 1.52 you could reach only the lightest blue curve. Your best choice would be 66 loaves, and your economic profit would be zero.














The marginal cost curve is the supply curve


In each case, you choose the point on your marginal cost curve where MC=market price. Your marginal cost curve is your supply curve.




For a price-taking firm, the marginal cost curve is the supply curve: for each price it shows the profit-maximizing quantitythat is, the quantity that the firm will choose to supply.
Notice, however, that if the price fell below 1.52 you would be making a loss. The supply curve shows how many loaves you should produce to maximize profit, but when the price is this low, the economic profit is nevertheless negative. On the supply curve, you would be minimizing your loss. If this happened, you would have to decide whether it was worth continuing to produce bread. Your decision depends on what you expect to happen in the future:

If you expect market conditions to remain bad, it might be best to sell up and leave the marketyou could obtain a better return on your capital elsewhere.
If you expect the price to rise soon, you might be willing to incur some short-term losses, and it might be worth continuing to produce bread if the revenue helped you to cover the costs of maintaining your premises and retaining staff.


Question 8.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 8.5 shows a price-taking bakerys marginal and average cost curves, and its isoprofit curves. The market price for bread is P*= 2.35. Which of the following statements is correct?

The firms supply curve is horizontal.
At the market price of 2.35, the firm will supply 62 loaves, at the point where the firm makes zero profit.
At any market price, the firms supply is given by the corresponding point on the average cost curve.
The marginal cost curve is the firms supply curve.


The firms demand curve is horizontal. Its supply curve is upward sloping.
At 2.35 the firm maximizes profit at point A, where it supplies 120 loaves.
At each price, the firm will choose a point on the highest isoprofit curve attainable, which will be a point on the marginal cost curve.
At each price, the firm maximizes profit by choosing the corresponding quantity on the marginal cost curve. So the marginal cost curve is its supply curve.
