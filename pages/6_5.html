6.4 Employment rents
There are many reasons why people put in a good days work. For many people, doing a good job is its own reward, and doing anything else would contradict their work ethic. Even for those not intrinsically motivated to work hard, feelings of responsibility for other employees or for ones employer may provide strong work motivation.
For some employees, hard work is a way to reciprocate a feeling of gratitude to the employer for providing a job with good working conditions. In other cases, firms identify teams of workers whose output is readily measuredfor example, the percentage of on-time departures for airline staffand pay a benefit to the whole group that is divided among team members.
But in the background, there is another reason to do a good job: the fear of being fired, or of missing the opportunity to be promoted into a position that has higher pay and greater job security.
Laws and practices concerning the termination of employment for cause (that is, because of inadequate or low quality work, not due to insufficient demand for the firms product) differ among countries. In some countries, the owners of the firm have the right to fire a worker whenever they choose, while in others, dismissal is difficult and costly. But even in these cases, an employee has to fear the consequences of not working up to the employers desired standards. Such a worker, for example, would be unlikely to achieve a position in the firm where she could count on remaining employed when lower demand for the firms products results in other workers being dismissed.
Do workers care whether they lose their jobs?

employment rentThe economic rent a worker receives when the net value of her job exceeds the net value of her next best alternative (that is, being unemployed). Also known as: cost of job loss.

If firms paid their employees the lowest wages they would be willing to accept, the answer would be no. Such a wage would make the worker indifferent between remaining in the job and losing it. But in practice most workers care very much. There is a difference between the value of the job (taking into account all the benefits and costs it entails) and the value of the next best optionwhich is being unemployed and having to search for a new job. In other words, there is an employment rent.
Employment rents can benefit owners and managers in two ways:

The employee is more likely to stay with the firm: If she were to quit the job, the firm would need to pay to recruit and train someone else.
They can threaten to fire the worker: Owners and managers exert power over employees because the employee has something to lose. The threat can be implicit or explicit, but it will make the worker perform in ways that she would not choose unless this was the case.

We can use the same reasoning in the employment of managers by the owners of the firm. The main reason owners wield power over managers is that they can fire them, and so eliminate their managerial employment rents.

How economists learn from facts Managers exert power
These examples show the effect of the power that managers and owners exert.

Labour economists Alan Krueger and Alexandre Mas unravel the mystery of why the tread on Bridgestone (Firestone) tyres was separating, endangering motorists and reducing profits.9
Barbara Ehrenreich worked undercover for minimum wage in motels and restaurants to see how Americas poor live.10
Polly Toynbee, a British journalist, had previously done the same in the UK in 2003, taking jobs such as call centre employee and care home worker.11
Harry Braverman provides a history of what he calls the deskilling process, and suggests how dumbing down jobs is a strategy for maximizing the employers profits.12



When economists agree Coase and Marx on the firm and its employees
The writer George Bernard Shaw (18561950) joked that if all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.
This is funny, but not entirely true.
For example, the two leading economists of the early nineteenth centuryRicardo and Malthuswere political opponents. Ricardo often sided with businesspeople, for example in supporting freer imports of grain to Britain to reduce food prices and allow lower wages. Malthus opposed him and supported the Corn Laws that restricted grain imports, a position favoured by the landed gentry. But the two economists both proposed the same theory of land rents, which we still use today.
Even more striking is that two economists from different centuries and political orientations came up with similar ways of understanding the firm and its employees.
In the nineteenth century, Marx contrasted the way that buyers and sellers interact on a market, voluntarily engaging in trade, with how the firm is organized as a topdown structure, one in which employers issue orders and workers follow them. He called markets a very Eden of the innate rights of man, but described firms as exploit[ing] labour-power to the greatest possible extent.
When Ronald Coase died in 2013, he was described by Forbes magazine as the greatest of the many great University of Chicago economists. The motto of Forbes is The capitalist tool, and the University of Chicago has a reputation as the centre of conservative economic thinking.
Yet, like Marx, Coase stressed the central role of authority in the firms contractual relations:

Note the character of the contract into which an [employee] enters that is employed within a firm for certain remuneration [the employee] agrees to obey the directions of the entrepreneur. (The nature of the firm, 1937)

Recall that Coase had also defined the firm by its political structure: If a workman moves from department Y to department X, he does not go because of a change in prices but because he is ordered to do so. He sought to understand why firms exist at all, quoting his contemporary D.H. Robertsons description of them as islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious cooperation.
Both based their thinking on careful empirical observation, and they arrived at a similar understanding of the hierarchy of the firm. They disagreed, however, on the consequences of what they observed: Coase thought that the hierarchy of the firm was a cost-reducing way to do business. Marx thought that the coercive authority of the boss over the worker limited the employees freedom. Like Malthus and Ricardo, Coase and Marx disagreed. But like Malthus and Ricardo, they also advanced economics with a common idea.

Counting the cost of job loss
Recall that an economic rent measures the value of a situationfor example, having your current jobcompared to what you would get if the current situation were no longer possible.
To calculate employment rentor in other words, the net cost of job losswe need to weigh up all the benefits and costs of working compared with being unemployed and searching for another job.
There are some costs of working, such as:

The disutility of work: Employees must spend time doing things they would prefer not to do.
The cost of travelling to work every day.

But there are many benefits, which would be lost if you lost your job:

Wage income: This may be partially offset by an unemployment benefit or, in poorer countries, by the possibility of lower-paying self-employment or work on the family farm.
Firm-specific assets: These include workplace friends, and perhaps the proximity of the workplace to your present home.
Medical insurance: The employer may pay for the employees healthcare in some countries.
The social status of being employed: In Unit 13 we will see that the stigma of being unemployed is equivalent to a substantial financial cost for most people.

Even confining attention to the loss in wages, the cost is high. But how do we measure how high it is?

How economists learn from facts How large are employment rents?
Setting aside the undoubtedly large but hard-to-measure psychological and social cost of losing ones job, estimating the cost of job loss (the size of the employment rent) is not simple.
Can we compare the economic situation of workers currently employed with the economic situation of unemployed people? No, because the unemployed are a different group of people, with different abilities and skills. Even if they were employed, they would be likely (on average) to earn less than people who currently have jobs.

natural experimentAn empirical study exploiting naturally occurring statistical controls in which researchers do not have the ability to assign participants to treatment and control groups, as is the case in conventional experiments. Instead, differences in law, policy, weather, or other events can offer the opportunity to analyse populations as if they had been part of an experiment. The validity of such studies depends on the premise that the assignment of subjects to the naturally occurring treatment and control groups can be plausibly argued to be random.

An entire firm closing, or a mass layoff of workers, provides a natural experiment that can help. We could look at the earnings of workers before and after they lost their job during a major employment cutback. When a factory closes because the parent company has decided to relocate production to some other part of the world, for example, virtually all workers lose their jobs, and not just the ones who were most likely to lose their jobs through poor performance.1314
Louis Jacobson, Robert Lalonde, and Daniel Sullivan used such a natural experiment to estimate the cost of job loss. They studied experienced (not recently hired) full-time workers hit by mass layoffs in the US state of Pennsylvania in 1982. In 2014 dollars, those displaced had been averaging $50,000 in earnings in 1979. Those who were fortunate enough to find another job in less than three months took jobs that paid a lot less, averaging only $35,000: being laid off meant that their earnings declined by $15,000.15
Four years later they were still making $13,300 less than similar workers who had been making the same initial wage, but whose firms did not lay off their workers. In the five years that followed their layoff they lost the equivalent of an entire years earnings.
Many, of course, did not find work at all. They suffered even greater costs.
The year 1982 was not a good time to be looking for work in Pennsylvania, but similar estimates (from the US state of Connecticut between 1993 and 2004 for example) suggest that even in better times, employment rents are large enough that workers would worry about losing them.


Question 6.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
In which of the following employment situations would the employment rent be high, ceteris paribus?

In a job that provides many benefits, such as housing and medical insurance.
In an economic boom, when the ratio of job-seekers to vacancies is low.
When the worker is paid a high salary because she is a qualified accountant and there is a shortage of accountancy skills.
When the worker is paid a high salary because the firms customers know and trust her.


If the employee loses the job, all these benefits would be lost, so the economic rent from employment is high.
The cost of job loss is low, because it would be easy to find another job. Therefore, the economic rent is low.
A qualified accountant will be able to find other jobs easily at a similar salary, so the economic rent is low.
This worker is paid a high salary because of firm-specific assets that will be lost if she leaves. Other firms would pay a lower salary (at least initially) so the economic rent is high.
