19.12 Conclusion
As you have seen in this unit, income inequality among the worlds households is falling fast, mostly because of the rapid increases in average income in two large and historically poor countries: China and India.
The most recent worldwide Gini coefficient for household income is 0.62. How unequal does that mean that people really are? We know that, for example, the average income of the top 1% in the world is 27 times the income of the poorest half of the people in the world.
But another way to see these differences, represented by a Gini coefficient of 0.62, is the following thought experiment. If you were to randomly pick pairs of households from all over the world and compare their incomeyou might get one family from Indonesia, one from Norway, one from Brazil, one from India, and two from China (that would not be a surprising outcome, likely even if you were randomly picking families)you would find that the richer of the two families, on average, had 4.2 times the income of the poorer. The very rich are very few, so when we include them it would not change this average inequality between households.
But are we even that different? Do you think that the income earner (or earners) in the richer of the two families would on average be 4.2 times stronger, smarter, more hard-working or creative? This shows us that the economy produces inequalities, even among people who may not be very different. It rewards some with large incomes, and others with barely enough to survive.
Many of these income differencesseen as rewards for hard work, risk-taking, or creativity for exampleare considered by most people to be entirely fair, or at least necessary to provide incentives for a well-working economy. Other income differencesthe effects of discrimination, coercion, or accidents of birth for example, are regarded by many as unfair.
Economics can help to address the problem of unfair inequality by clarifying the causes of economic inequality and designing policies that can ensure more just outcomes, as has been done in many countries.
