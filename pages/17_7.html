17.6 The end of the golden age

stagflationPersistent high inflation combined with high unemployment in a countrys economy.

The virtuous circle of the golden age began to break down in the late 1960s, in part as a result of its own successes. Years of low unemployment convinced workers that they had little chance of losing their jobs. Their demands for improvements in working conditions and higher wages drove down the profit rate. The postwar accord and its rationale of enlarging the pie gave way to a contest over the size of the slice that each group could get. This set the stage for the period of combined inflation and stagnation called stagflation that would follow.
Greater industrial strife in the late 1960s in leading economies signalled the breakdown of the golden age postwar accords. Figure 17.14 plots the days on strike per 1,000 industrial workers in advanced economies from 1950 to 2002. As strike activity peaked, wages measured relative to share prices increased rapidly. The postwar accords that helped create the golden age collapsed.

Workers also demanded policies to redistribute income to the less well off and to provide more adequate social services, making it difficult for governments to run a budget surplus. In the US, additional military spending to fund the Vietnam War added to aggregate demand, keeping the economy at unsustainably high levels of employment.
The process is represented in Figure 17.15 by an upward shift in the wage-setting curve (to the one labelled late 1960s/early 70s). At the same time, economy-wide productivity growth slowed (see Figure 17.2 for the US data). As the gap between the technology frontier in the US and in the catch-up countries in western Europe narrowed, it was more difficult to get easy gains from technology transfer (see Figure 17.11).
In 1973, the first oil price shock occurred. In Figure 17.15, this contributes to the downward shift of the price-setting curve (see the price-setting curve labelled 197379 and refer back to Figure 15.11). Higher imported oil costs reduce the maximum real wage that workers can get if firms are to keep their profit margin unchanged.

The postwar accord collapses


The upward shift in the wage-setting curve represents the collapse of postwar accords during the late 1960s and early 1970s.














The first oil shock (1973)


In 1973, the first oil price shock occurred. This pushed the price-setting curve down.














Inflation-stabilizing unemployment increases


The combination of a downward shift in the price-setting curve and an upward shift in the wage-setting curve meant that the sustainable long-term unemployment rate increased to 7%, shown at point D.














A bargaining gap develops


The double-headed arrow at low unemployment shows the situation in the early 1970s.




What happened?
Wages did not rise to the level of point C. Under the impact of the upward pressure on wages and the oil price shock, the economy contracted and unemployment began to rise. But even a significant reduction in employment (short of increasing the unemployment rate to 7%) did not eliminate the bargaining gap shown in the figure. A result was an increase in the rate of inflation, as is shown in Figure 17.16.
Because of the strong bargaining position of workers in the early 1970s in most of the high-income economies, the oil price shock primarily hit employers, redistributing income from profits to wages (Figure 17.15). The era of fair-shares bargaining under the postwar accords was coming to aclose.

It uses the labour market model (also referred to as the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve model). See also: demand side (aggregate economy).

In the US and most of the high-income countries, unions were strong enough to defend their share of the pie even after the oil price increase and they chose to do so. In terms of the model, this meant wages were above the new price-setting curve. This cut into profits, so investment fell and the rate of productivity growth slowed. As predicted by the model in Figure 17.15, the outcome was rising inflation (Figure 17.16), falling profits (Figure 17.3), weak investment (Figure 17.3), and high unemployment (Figure17.16).
In a handful of countries with inclusive and powerful trade unions (as described in Unit 16), the accord survived. In Sweden, for example, the powerful centralized labour movement restrained its wage claims to preserve profitability, investment, and high levels of employment (Figure16.1).

The end of the golden age set off a new economic crisis, one that was very different from the Great Depression. The economic downturn of the 1930s had been propelled by problems of aggregate demand and for this reason it has been called a demand-side crisis. The end of the golden age has been called a supply-side crisis, because problems on the supply side of the economy depressed the profit rate, the rate of investment, and the rate of productivity growth.
The period that ensued came to be called stagflation because it combined high unemployment and high inflation. If the golden age was an unusual time during which everything went right at once, stagflation was an unusual time in which everything went wrong.
According to the Phillips curve model of Unit 15, inflation goes up when unemployment goes down; this is a movement along the Phillips curve. Figure 17.16 summarizes the unemployment and inflation data for the advanced economies from 19602013.











Figure 15.6 shows the inflation and unemployment combinations for the US for each year between 1960 and 2014.
        




Just as the Phillips curve predicts, for most of the period, inflation and unemployment were negatively correlated: as unemployment rose, inflation fell and vice versa. But as we saw in Figure 15.6, the entire Phillips curve shifted upward during this period, as a bargaining gap opened and expected inflation increased. Look at the shaded part of Figure 17.16: inflation and unemployment rose together, giving this period its name.

Question 17.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 17.14 is a graph of days on strike per 1,000 industrial workers (left-hand axis) and the average wages relative to share prices (right-hand axis) in advanced economies between 1950 and 2002.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

Strikes are beneficial to all workers.
Nearly half of the workers went on strike at the peak of the strike activity between 1975 and 1980.
The postwar accord of cooperation between employers and employees broke down in the late 1960s.
The first oil shock of 1973 triggered a sharp rise in average wages.


The data do not support this statement. The data suggest that the increase in strike activity was followed by a distributional shift from profits to wages. It does not show what happened to real wages or to unemployment.
500 days on strike per 1,000 workers does not mean that 500 workers went on strike for a day each. The same data could be generated with a few workers going on strike for a long time or many workers going on strike for shorter times.
This is indicated by the fact that days on strike started to rise sharply in the late 1960s.
The oil shock may have contributed to a fall in the share prices (the Dow Jones Index halved between November 1972 and September 1974), reducing the denominator in the ratio of wages to share prices. But it cannot be stated that it triggered a rise in average wages (the numerator).



Question 17.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 17.15 describes the movements in employment, profits, and wages in the 1950s to 1970s using the labour market model.
Which of the following statements is correct regarding this period?

The collapse of postwar accords in the late 1960s/early 70s led to workers demanding higher wages, leading to an upward shift in the wage-setting curve.
The reduction in the tax rate introduced to counter the effect of the oil shock led to the fall in the price-setting curve.
The rise in the wage-setting curve led to the wage rate rising to point C.
The economy swiftly settled at the new labour market equilibrium at D, with stable inflation, unemployment, profits, and wages.


Workers increasingly used the tactic of industrial strikes to attempt to push up wages.
The oil shock contributed to the fall in the price-setting curve, together with the slowdown in the productivity growth. The tax cut offset this somewhat.
The wages did not actually rise to C, but instead the bargaining gap between the wage demanded by workers (at C) and that offered by firms (given by the price-setting curve) led to higher inflation.
Wages remained above the new (lower) price-setting curve, leading to lower investment. The resulting outcome was stagflation involving rising inflation, falling profits, weak investment, and high unemployment.



Question 17.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 17.16 is a graph of the unemployment rate and consumer price inflation in advanced economies between 1960 and 2013.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

As predicted by the Phillips curve, the unemployment rate rises whenever inflation falls and vice versa throughout the period depicted.
The unemployment rate and the inflation rate were consistently positively correlated during the stagflation period of the 1970s.
Stagflation was caused by the shifting up of the Phillips curve, propelled by higher inflation expectations.
The end of stagflation was characterized by falls in both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.


This negative correlation relationship broke down during the 1970s.
Between 1975 and 1978, the inflation rate fell significantly while the unemployment rate continued to rise, making the two negatively correlated in this sub-period.
The shifting up of the Phillips curve means a higher rate of inflation for any unemployment level, which is what happened during the stagflation period.
The end of stagflation in the early 1980s was characterized by a rapid fall in the inflation rate. However the unemployment rate rose, restoring the negative correlation between the two.
