19.11 Equality and economic performance
The success of Operation Barga in raising productivity in farming (Unit 5), of Oportunidades in Mexico, and of pensions in South Africa in raising school achievement and child health may help explain the fact that more equal countries do as well as (or better than) unequal countries, in terms of standard economic performance.
We saw in Figure 17.15 that the low levels of inequality, the enhanced power of trade unions, and the growth of pro-poor tax and transfer policies during the golden age of capitalism were associated with the most rapid growth of income per capita in modern history. Investment, too, occurred at levels not seen before, raising the capital stock at an unprecedented rate of growth.
Earlier in this unit (Figure 19.3) we showed the centuries-long U-turn of top incomes in many countries including the US and the UK. By this measure, late twentieth-century inequality had risen to levels not experienced since before the Great Depression. But this U-turn pattern is far from universal, as Figure 19.4 showed.
Most of the countries in Figure 19.4where the U-turn towards greater inequality did not occur or was far less pronouncedare high performers. These countries achieved both rapid growth in income per capita and modest levels of inequality of disposable income, as you can see in Figure 19.30a. In this case, we measure inequality in income after taxes and transfers (disposable income) because this is the best available measure of inequality available across all countries. The conclusion from Figure 19.30a is that countries differ a lot in how equal their living standards are, and that the growth in productivity (GDP per capita) seems unrelated to the level of equality.

There have also been high and low performers among the catch-up countries. Figure 19.30b shows that South Korea and Taiwan were able to achieve high growth with relatively low inequality over the past 30 years, whereas the performance of Latin American economies along both of these dimensions was typically much worse.

Figures 19.30a and 19.30b are initially surprising because economists have often claimed that high taxes and transfers depress incentives for people to work hard and take the kinds of risk necessary for innovation to occur. Explanations of why egalitarian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in Asia, and Nordic and other northern European countries have done so well economically include:

High levels of cooperation and trust: An economy based on services such as the production of knowledge and care of others cannot perform well if people are entirely self-interested. Cooperation and trust are essential for much of the modern economy, but they are difficult to sustain among people paid vastly different sums of money. Societies that are more equal create more trust among citizens and therefore enjoy better economic performance.
Policies that enhance the endowments of the poor: High-quality health services and education contribute to the more productive use of an economys resources. This is also true of policies that raise the value of the endowments of the poor, as illustrated by the land reform (Operation Barga) in West Bengal.
Less use of guard labour: The construction of secure environments for the rich, such as gated communities, and other guarding activities that protect the assets of and provide security to the wealthy divert resources that could be used for productive investment.1314

Figure 19.30c illustrates this last point: the US, Italy, and the UK are countries with highly unequal disposable incomes that hire three times as many guards (public and private security personnel, excluding armed forces) than do the more equal nations of Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. An unequal society may expend a lot of resources on protecting property rights and enforcing the rule of law.

Exercise 19.11 The U-turn countries
Look again at the difference between the U-turn countries in Figure 19.3, which showed a trend towards greater equality in the first three quarters of the twentieth century followed by an increase in inequality since about 1980, and the countries in Figure 19.4, in which inequality did not increase significantly, or at all.
Make a list of possible explanations as to why countries in the two groups took such different courses since 1980, making sure to check (using the Internet or other sources) that any technological or institutional changes you refer to are historically accurate.


Exercise 19.12 High and low performers











 
Inequality and economic performance: High and low performers.
        




Above, we have arbitrarily drawn a line on Figure 19.30a to distinguish high from low performers. But what counts as high performance depends on your preferences.

Sketch your indifference curves in the space given by Figure 19.30a, according to your preferences for inequality and growth. (Hint: is the slope of the indifference curve positive or negative?)
Use your indifference curves to rank the countries in Figure 19.30a, from the most to the least preferable.



Question 19.10 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding policies on inequality?

Japan has a more equal society compared to the US due to its large equalizing effect of taxes and transfers.
Providing high-quality education to citizens is a way of raising the endowments of less well off people.
An increase in the minimum wage increases unemployment, leading to higher inequality unambiguously.
Non-compete contracts mean that workers can demand higher wages, leading to reduced inequality.


Japan is a more equal society than the US in terms of wealth or earnings even before taxes and transfers.
Giving everyone access to education, regardless of wealth, is one way to make the human capital endowments of the rich and poor more equal.
The evidence so far suggests otherwise; the benefit of a wage increase more than offsets the cost of a possible (if any) decrease in employment by a wide margin (see the Economist in action video of Arin Dube).
Non-compete contracts prohibit workers from leaving their firm for a competitor. This reduces their bargaining power, leading to lower wages.
