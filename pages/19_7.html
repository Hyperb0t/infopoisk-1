19.6 Inequality, endowments, and principalagent relationships
Recall that the labour and credit market models in Units 9 and 10 provided the background for our macroeconomic models of the functioning of the whole economy and for the study of how shocks and policies affect economy-wide employment, incomes, and inflation. We used the Lorenz curve to summarize the effects on inequality. And in explaining the model of inequality in Figure 19.16, we used examples from the labour and credit markets.

principalagent relationshipThis relationship exists when one party (the principal) would like another party (the agent) to act in some way, or have some attribute that is in the interest of the principal, and that cannot be enforced or guaranteed in a binding contract. See also: incomplete contract. Also known as: principalagent problem.

The principalagent models also give us a new way to study an important dimension of inequality: differences in power affect the type of choices that a person may feasibly make. Principals are in a position to exercise power over agents, but agents rarely can exercise power over principals. Here is why.
The employer (the owner or the manager who is the principal in the labour market) has the power to determine what the firm will produce, using what technology, and in which country to locate production. They also have the power to set the wage and the tasks that a worker is directed to perform, and can also fire the worker. The worker chooses how to go about her work within limits that the employer sets.
Recall that in order to motivate the worker to work hard and well, the employer sets a wage so that the employee is better off with the job than she would be without it, receiving an economic rent. The employer can fire the worker and deprive her of the employment rent she would otherwise receive. The fear of losing this rent is an important reason for the worker to carry out the employers wishes. It is also the reason why the employer has power over the employee.
The worker could, of course, quit. But this does not make the relationship equal when it comes to power. If she is receiving an economic rent she would penalize herself by quitting, and her employer would just replace her with someone currently unemployed.
We can contrast this with the relationships among price-taking buyers and sellers at the equilibrium of a competitive market. None of these traders is in a position to demand that any other trader act in one way or another. Think about the buyer, for example, who orders the seller to make the good available at a lower price, threatening not to buy otherwise. What would the seller do? Nothing. The seller can sell as much as she wishes at the going price (remember, the demand curve facing an individual firm is flat).
A second contrast is with the interactions we studied in Unit 4 where the actions open to all parties were identicalfor example, either use integrated pest management or chemical fertilizers, either learn C++ or Java.
Like the relationship between the employer and employee, the other principalagent models we have seen reflect the unequal relationships between groups of people with differing endowments, such as landlords and tenant farmers, and borrowers and lenders.
Figure 19.19 illustrates how the credit and labour markets influence the relationships among the groups of lenders and borrowers, and employers and employees.
Starting at the upper left of the figure, wealthy individuals can use their wealth to purchase the capital goods to become employers and they can also lend to others. Among the less wealthy, there will be some successful borrowers who can as a result also become employers. Those with even less wealth cannot borrow (they are the credit market excluded that you studied in Unit 10, or can only borrow where the house provides the collateral for the mortgage), and must seek work as employees. Employers then hire employees from among the less wealthy, with some remaining unemployed (due to the workings of the labour market that you studied in Units 6, 9, and15).
Horizontal arrows indicate a principalagent relationship. Lenders and employers are the principals in the figure; their common red colour indicates this similarity. Agentssuccessful borrowers, and employeesare coloured green to distinguish them from would-be agents (credit market excluded and unemployed) who are coloured purple. You definitely do not want to be in the purple boxes. But even if you are an agent lucky enough to be in one of the green boxes, the principal can put you back in the purple box just by refusing to deal with you. This is why lenders and employers have power over borrowers and employees.

A model economy


Consider an economy with wealthy individuals and employees.














Credit market excluded


Those without wealth (collateral) or insufficient wealth are excluded from the credit market.














Wealthy individuals and successful borrowers


These people can purchase capital goods so as to become employers.














Those who are not wealthy


These are employees or unemployed.














Employers hire employees on the labour market


This excludes the unemployed.




Figure 19.19 helps us understand why some people end up as principals (employers, for example) while others end up as agents (employees). If one is wealthy, one can be both a lender and an employer. There is some truth to the saying that people are born into their position in the economic order. This was literally true in some economies of the past. For example, the position of the slave was perpetuated by the enslavement of their children as a matter of law.
Something similar can occur in places where wealth is inherited from parent to child. The children of employees (who inherit little wealth) are also more likely to become the next generations workers than are the children of employers. You already saw that the children of well off parents in the US also tend to have high incomes when they become adults (Figure 19.10).
But look again at that figure: there is some mobility among the income groups even in the US and there is very little intergenerational inequality in Denmark. Becoming an employer requires that one has sufficient wealth. But inheriting wealth from a parent is not the only way, and in some countries not even the most important way to acquire wealth. The wealth necessary to become an employer may be acquired by saving. It may also be acquired by developing a great project and persuading investors called venture capitalists to fund it.
We have also seen in Units 13 and 16 that there are transitions by individuals between boxes over their life-time. A younger person may initially be a borrower and then be a lender later in life; a spell of unemployment can be followed by one of employment.

Question 19.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements are correct?

Endowments are facts about an individual that may affect his or her income.
Having or not having a degree does not constitute a difference in endowments if it is a matter of individual choice.
All individuals have the same reservation option irrespective of their endowments.
A visa (permission to work for a non-citizen) is not an element of an individuals endowment because it cannot be sold.


This is the definition of endowment.
Whether one has a degree or not affects the income of the individuals. Therefore one with a degree and one without have different endowments.
Reservation options depend on the individuals endowments. For example, a firm owners reservation option is to hire another employee, while an employees reservation option is receiving an unemployment benefit.
Marketability is not part of the definition of an endowment. An endowment is anythingincluding the right visathat can affect an individuals income.
