16.12 Wages and unemployment in the long run
We have learned that national economies differ not only in how rapidly they adjust to the opportunities offered by technological change and other changes of circumstance, but also in the wages and employment that they can sustain in the long run.
These depend on many of the characteristics of economies that we have analysed in earlier units. Figure 16.20 summarizes the determinants of the unemployment rate and the growth rate of real wages, and notes the units where these concepts are discussed.
Figure 16.21 builds on Figure 16.20 by showing the institutions and policies that can affect the growth of real wages and the unemployment rate.
