2.5 Modelling a dynamic economy: Innovation and profit
We have seen that when the wage is 10 and the price of coal is 20, B is the least-cost technology.
Any change in the relative price of these two inputs will change the slope of the isocost lines. Looking at the positions of the three technologies in Figure 2.7, we can imagine that if the isocost line becomes sufficiently steep (with the wage rising relative to the cost of coal), B will no longer be the least-cost technology: the firm will switch to A. This is what happened in England in the eighteenth century.
Lets look at how a change in relative prices could cause this to happen. Suppose that the price of coal falls to 5 while the wage remains at 10.
Looking at the table in Figure 2.7, with the new prices, the A-technology allows the firm to produce 100 metres of cloth at least cost. Cheaper coal makes each method of production cheaper, but the energy-intensive technology is now cheapest.

When the wage is 10 and the price of coal is 5, the table shows that the A-technology, which is more energy-intensive than the others, can produce 100 metres of cloth at a lower cost than B or E.

The A-technology is on the isocost line FG. At any point on this line, the total cost of inputs is 40. Technologies B and E are above this line, with higher costs.

The slope of the isocost line


The slope of the isocost line can be found by calculating the relative price of labour. It is equal to (10/5) = 2. If you spent 10 on labour by hiring an extra worker, you could reduce coal by 2 tonnes and keep the total cost at 40.




Remember that to draw the isocost line through any point, such as A, we calculate the cost at A (40) then look for another point with the same cost. The easiest way is to find one of the end points F or G. For example, if no coal was used, four workers could be hired for 40. This is point F.
You can see from Figure 2.7 that with the new relative price the A-technology lies on the 40 isocost line, and the other two available technologies lie above it. They will not be chosen if the A-technology is available.
How does a cost-reducing innovation raise the profits of the firm?
The next step is to calculate the gains to the first firm to adopt the least-cost technology (A) when the relative price of labour to coal rises. Like all its competitors, the firm is initially using the B-technology and minimizing its costs: this is shown in Figure 2.8 by the dashed isocost line through B (with end points H and J).
Once the relative prices change, the new isocost line through the B-technology is steeper and the cost of production is 50. Switching to the A-technology (which is more energy-intensive and less labour-intensive) to produce 100 metres of cloth reduces costs to 40. Follow the steps in Figure2.8 to see how isocost lines change with the new relative prices.

At the original relative price, B is the lower cost technology


When the wage is 10 and the price of coal is relatively high at 20, the cost of producing 100 metres of cloth using technology B is 80: choosing the B-technology puts the firm on the HJ isocost curve.

The price of coal falls to 5


If the price of coal falls relative to the wage as shown by the isocost curve FG, then using the A-technology, which is more energy-intensive than B, costs 40. From the table, we see that with these relative prices, A is now the least-cost technology.

B now costs more than A


At the new relative prices, the B-technology is on the isocost line MN, where the cost is 50. Switching to technology A will be cheaper.




The firms profits are equal to the revenue it gets from selling output minus its costs.
Whether the new or old technology is used, the same prices have to be paid for labour and coal, and the same price is received for selling 100metres of cloth. The change in profit is thus equal to the fall in costs associated with adopting the new technology, and profits rise by 10 per 100 metres of cloth:

In this case, the economic rent for a firm switching from B to A is 10 per 100 metres of cloth, which is the cost reduction made possible by the new technology. The decision rule (if the economic rent is positive, do it!) tells the firm to innovate.

entrepreneurA person who creates or is an early adopter of new technologies, organizational forms, and other opportunities.

In our example, the A-technology was available, but not in use until a first-adopter firm responded to the incentive created by the increase in the relative price of labour. The first adopter is called an entrepreneur. When we describe a person or firm as entrepreneurial, it refers to a willingness to try out new technologies and to start new businesses.
The economist Joseph Schumpeter (see below) made the adoption of technological improvements by entrepreneurs a key part of his explanation for the dynamism of capitalism. This is why innovation rents are often called Schumpeterian rents.
Innovation rents will not last forever. Other firms, noticing that entrepreneurs are making economic rents, will eventually adopt the new technology. They will also reduce their costs and their profits will increase.

creative destructionJoseph Schumpeters name for the process by which old technologies and the firms that do not adapt are swept away by the new, because they cannot compete in the market. In his view, the failure of unprofitable firms is creative because it releases labour and capital goods for use in new combinations.

In this case, with higher profits per 100 metres of cloth, the lower-cost firms will thrive. They will increase their output of cloth. As more firms introduce the new technology, the supply of cloth to the market increases and the price will start to fall. This process will continue until everyone is using the new technology, at which stage prices will have declined to the point where no one is earning innovation rents. The firms that stuck to the old B-technology will be unable to cover their costs at the new lower price for cloth, and they will go bankrupt. Joseph Schumpeter called this creative destruction.

Question 2.3 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 2.3 shows different technologies for producing 100metres of cloth.
From the graph, what can we conclude?

Technology D is more energy-intensive than technology C.
Technology B dominates technology D.
Technology A is the cost-minimizing technology at all prices of coal and wages.
Technology C can sometimes be a cheaper technology than A.


Technology D uses more workers and less coal, and therefore is more labour-intensive than C.
Technology B uses fewer workers and fewer tonnes of coal than technology D to produce the same amount of cloth, so it dominates D.
Technology A would be costlier than B, D or E if the price of coal were much higher than the wage level.
Technology C is dominated by A as it uses both more workers and more coal than A. Therefore it can never be a cheaper technology than A.



Question 2.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Look at the three isocost lines in Figure 2.8.
Based on this information, what can we conclude?

When the wage is 10 and the price of coal is 5, the combination of inputs at point N is more costly than the inputs at point B.
Isocosts MN and FG represent the same price ratio (wage/price of coal) but different total costs of production.
Isocost HJ represents a higher (wage/price of coal) ratio than isocost FG.
Isocost HJ represents all points that can produce 100 metres of cloth at a particular price ratio.


At these prices, N and B are on the same isocost line. These two combinations of inputs cost the same.
The price ratio is equal to the slope of an isocost; since isocosts MN and FG have the same slope, we can infer that they represent the same price ratio. MN is higher than FG, so represents higher total costs.
Isocost FG has a slope of 2 (replacing two tonnes of coal with one worker leaves the total cost of production the same), while isocost HJ has slope 0.5 (replacing one tonne of coal with two workers leaves the total cost the same). This means that labour is relatively cheaper along HJ, or isocost HJ has a lower wage/price of coal ratio.
An isocost represents all combinations of workers and tonnes of coal for which the total cost of production is the same. Along isocost HJ we know that at point B (4 workers and 2 tonnes of coal) the technology can produce 100 metres of cloth. If a technology were available to produce at another point on the line it would not necessarily produce 100 metres of cloth.








Lynne Kiesling, a historian of economic thought, discusses Joseph Schumpeter.



Great economists Joseph Schumpeter

evolutionary economicsAn approach that studies the process of economic change, including technological innovation, the diffusion of new social norms, and the development of novel institutions.


Joseph Schumpeter (18831950) developed one of the most important concepts of modern economics: creative destruction.
Schumpeter brought to economics the idea of the entrepreneur as the central actor in the capitalist economic system. The entrepreneur is the agent of change who introduces new products, new methods of production, and opens up new markets. Imitators follow, and the innovation is diffused through the economy. A new entrepreneur and innovation launch the next upswing.
For Schumpeter, creative destruction was the essential fact about capitalism: old technologies and the firms that do not adapt are swept away by the new, because they cannot compete in the market by selling goods at a price that covers the cost of production. The failure of unprofitable firms releases labour and capital goods for use in new combinations.
This decentralized process generates a continued improvement in productivity, which leads to growth, so Schumpeter argued it is virtuous.9 Both the destruction of old firms and the creation of new ones take time. The slowness of this process creates upswings and downswings in the economy. The branch of economic thought known as evolutionary economics (you can read articles on the subject in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics) can clearly trace its origins to Schumpeters work, as well as most modern economic modelling that deals with entrepreneurship and innovation. Read Schumpeters ideas and opinions in his own words.1011
Schumpeter was born in Austro-Hungary, but migrated to the US after the Nazis won the election in 1932 that led to the formation of the Third Reich in 1933. He had also experienced the First World War and the Great Depression of the 1930s, and died while writing an essay called The march into socialism, recording his concerns about the increasing role of government in the economy and the resulting migration of peoples economic affairs from the private into the public sphere. As a young professor in Austria he had fought and won a duel with the university librarian to ensure that students had access to books. He also claimed that as a young man he had three ambitions in life: to become the worlds greatest economist, the worlds greatest lover, and the worlds greatest horseman. He added that only the decline of the cavalry had stopped him from succeeding in all three.
