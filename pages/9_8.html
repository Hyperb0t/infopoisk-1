9.7 How changes in demand for goods and services affect unemployment
At the beginning of this unit, you read about the father and son working in the Australian minerals sector (Doug and Rob Grey). The boom and bust in their lives reflected changes in economic conditions in the Australian economy as a whole. The minerals boom had produced the large-scale construction of mining facilities in Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. As construction was coming to an end on existing projects, global iron ore prices collapsed, with the result that new mines, ports and processing facilities were not started. In Figure 9.1, unemployment began to rise as the global price of iron ore plummeted.
Unemployment increased because the demand for labour in mining and in the related service activities shrank. Not only did the demand for minerals fall off, but demand also declined for the goods and services that the Grey family and others like them would have purchased if they had kept their jobs. As a result, demand for goods and services fell across the economy, and with it the derived demand for labour. The term derived demand for labour is used to highlight the fact that the firms demand for labour depends on the demand for their goods and services.

cyclical unemploymentThe increase in unemployment above equilibrium unemployment caused by a fall in aggregate demand associated with the business cycle. Also known as: demand-deficient unemployment. See also: equilibrium unemployment.

Economists use the term aggregatemeaning added up to measure the whole, not just the partsto describe economy-wide facts or variables. Aggregate demand, for example, is the sum of the demand for all of the goods and services produced in the economy, whether from consumers, firms, the government, or buyers in other countries. The increase in unemployment caused by the fall in aggregate demand is called demand-deficient unemploymentor, as we shall learn in Unit 13, cyclical unemployment.
How does this demand-deficient unemployment appear in our model of the labour market, and how does it relate to unemployment in the Nash equilibrium of the labour market?

unemployment, involuntaryThe state of being out of work, but preferring to have a job at the wages and working conditions that otherwise identical employed workers have. See also: unemployment.

Follow the steps in Figure 9.13 to compare unemployment in the labour market equilibrium (at X) with the unemployment caused by a low level of aggregate demand (at B). An unemployed person at X is involuntarily unemployed because that person would accept a job at the real wage shown by the intersection of the wage and price-setting curves.
An unemployed person at point B is also involuntarily unemployed. In fact, such a person would accept a job with a wage below the wage shown at B, and still be willing to work hard on the job.

Point X


At X, unemployment is at its labour market equilibrium level. Someone losing a job at X is not indifferent between being employed and unemployed because they experience a cost of losing the job.














Point B


At B, there are additional people looking for work who are also involuntarily unemployed. The additional unemployment at B is due to low aggregate demand and is called demand-deficient, or cyclical, unemployment.














The Nash equilibrium


At point B, total involuntary unemployment is given by the sum of cyclical and equilibrium unemployment. Point X is the Nash equilibrium of the labour market, which means that all actors are doing the best they can, given the actions of the other actors. No worker or firm can improve their position by changing their actions.




We term the level of joblessness at point X equilibrium unemployment, but what about point B? Could high demand-deficient unemployment be a long-term outcome? Will the behaviour of firms and workers result in the disappearance of the unemployment caused by insufficient aggregate demand?
We can see that B is not a Nash equilibrium. At this point the HR departmentnoting the high unemployment ratewould definitely say: With such high unemployment, we could pay our workers much less and they would still do their work! Because the firm could make higher profits by lowering the wage, as long as it remained above the wage-setting curve, B is not a Nash equilibrium.
But even so, an outcome such as B could persist for a long time, without public policies to expand employment.
To see why, we first need to understand how a decision to lower the wage by HR departments across the economy could (under the right circumstances) lead to the disappearance of cyclical unemployment. Imagine the economy was at point B (with all firms at points like B in Figure 9.9). Then the following sequence would take place, initiated by HR:

Lower wages would lower costs.
The degree of competition facing the firm has not changed, so it would want to set a price to restore the profit-maximizing markup.
Given the lower costs, firms would therefore cut prices.
Because the demand curve facing the firm is downward-sloping they would sell more, expanding output and employment.

Figure 9.14 shows the firms adjustment process. The wage is cut to the lower level by HR, and given the lower costs, the marketing department cuts the price to maximize profit. Firms would move to the right along their demand curve. Output and employment increase.
To see where the firms price cutting will stop, think about the new isoprofit curves once the cost of hiring labour has declined. Remember from Unit 7 that as the cost (C) has fallen, at every point on the isoprofit curve is now at a higher profit level than was the case prior to the decline in wages.
Importantly, it is also steeper than before. Recall that the slope of the isoprofit curve is (p  C)/q so that for example, at point B (q*, p*) the slope of the isoprofit curve with the lower wage is steeper.
Follow the steps in Figure 9.14 to see where the firm will set its price.

The new isoprofit curve


The new (lower wage) isoprofit curve passing through the original point B is now steeper than the demand curve, so the firm can do better by lowering its price and moving down the demand curve, selling more.














Maximum profits


It will continue doing this until it reaches a point on the demand curve where one of the new darker blue isoprofit curves is tangent to the demand curve. The firm maximizes profits at point X.




What could go wrong?
This process explains how wage and price cutting might lead the economy to move from B back to X. But real economies do not function so smoothly.1 What could possibly go wrong?
Worker resistance to a reduction in the nominal wage
The HR department would know that lowering the nominal wages of its employees would not be a simple matter, because it means that the actual monetary amount received by all existing workers would have to be smaller. As we saw in Unit 6, firms are often reluctant to cut nominal wages because it may reduce worker morale and result in conflict with employees. Strikes and worker resistance such as informal go slow tactics would disrupt the production process. For these reasons the HR department might hesitate to impose nominal wage cuts on its workers.2
Wage and price reductions might not lead to higher sales and employment
For the adjustment from B to X to occur, firms across the economy have to adjust wages and prices downward, and in response, firms and households have to increase their demand for goods and services by enough to restore economy-wide (or aggregate) demand to its level at point X. For the individual firm, a fall in price leads to higher sales. But falling prices across the economy can lead to cutbacks in spending, which shift the demand curves facing firms to the left. Falling prices can lead households to postpone spending, as they hope to get better bargains later. The gap in spending would be exacerbated by such behaviour. Moreover, as wages fall people may spend less, reducing demand.
Thus, in the presence of deficient aggregate demand, the usual profit-seeking decisions of firms and the responses of consumers, when added up across the economy, cannot be guaranteed to move the economy from B to the Nash equilibrium at X.
The role of government policy
Fortunately, there is another way to get from B back to the Nash equilibrium. The government could adopt policies to increase its own spending and expand the demand facing the firms. In this case, at point B firms would find that they were producing less than the profit-maximizing amount and would employ more people, instead of wanting to reduce wages. Policies to affect the total demand in the economy are considered in Units 1317.
Figure 9.15 illustrates this case. As before, the economy begins (following the fall in economy-wide demand) at point B. Rather than either waiting for a revival in aggregate demand (for example, through a recovery in global demand for minerals) or waiting for the process of wage and price reductions to spread across the economy, the government can increase the level of aggregate demand.

Before the increase in demand


As before, the firm begins at point B.














The demand curve shifts to the right


Remember, the isoprofit curves do not shift when the demand curve shifts. The firm moves on to a new higher isoprofit curve if demand rises as a result of higher economy-wide demand following monetary or fiscal policy actions.





monetary policyCentral bank (or government) actions aimed at influencing economic activity through changing interest rates or the prices of financial assets. See also: quantitative easing.


fiscal policyChanges in taxes or government spending in order to stabilize the economy. See also: fiscal stimulus, fiscal multiplier, aggregate demand.

One method is for the central bank to make borrowing cheaper by reducing the interest rate. The aim is to provide incentives for people to bring forward some of their spending decisions, particularly on things that are often purchased with borrowed money such as housing and automobiles. We look closely at this monetary policy in Unit 10 (Banks, money and the credit market) and in Unit 15 (Inflation, unemployment and monetary policy). Other methods are for the government to increase its spending or reduce tax rates. These fiscal policies are the subject of Unit 14 (Unemployment and fiscal policy).
We can summarize what we have learned in Figures 9.16 ac. When aggregate demand in the economy is too low, unemployment is higher than at the Nash equilibrium. The government or central bank can eliminate this demand-deficient unemployment through fiscal or monetary policy. These policies are likely to be a more rapid way of reducing unemployment compared to solely relying on the combination of downward adjustment of wages and prices by firms throughout the economy and increased demand by households and firms for goods and services.
The adjustment via fiscal or monetary policy is shown in Figure 9.16a, the adjustment via wage and price cuts is shown in Figure 9.16b, and the aggregate labour market is shown in Figure 9.16c.

Exercise 9.5 Wages and aggregate demand
We saw that if an economy has low aggregate demand with high cyclical unemployment, then automatic adjustment back to equilibrium could occur through a process of wage and price cuts. Imagine you are a worker and you see that many workers have lost their jobs while other workers are having their wages cut.

How might this affect your spending and saving decisions?
How might this affect adjustment back to equilibrium?



Question 9.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 9.13 depicts the labour market when there has been a negative aggregate demand shock. Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The new equilibrium B is a Nash equilibrium.
At B, unemployment is purely cyclical.
At B, the firms are able to make higher profits by lowering the wage.
The adjustment back from B to X is immediate.


B is not a Nash equilibrium as the firms are able to make higher profits by lowering the wage.
At B, total unemployment is the sum of equilibrium and cyclical unemployment.
At B, the real wage is above the wage-setting curve, so firms are able to lower the wage and still make the workers work hard. This leads to higher profits.
An outcome such as B after a negative aggregate demand shock can persist for a long time in the absence of public policies to expand employment.
