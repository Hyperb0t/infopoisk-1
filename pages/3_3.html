3.2 Preferences

preferencesA description of the benefit or cost we associate with each possible outcome.

If Alexei has the production function shown in Figure 3.5, how many hours per day will he choose to study? The decision depends on his preferencesthe things that he cares about. If he cared only about grades, he should study for 15 hours a day. But, like other people, Alexei also cares about his free timehe likes to sleep, go out or watch TV. So he faces a trade-off: how many percentage points is he willing to give up in order to spend time on things other than study?
We illustrate his preferences using Figure 3.6, with free time on the horizontal axis and final grade on the vertical axis. Free time is defined as all the time that he does not spend studying. Every point in the diagram represents a different combination of free time and final grade. Given his production function, not every combination that Alexei would want will be possible, but for the moment we will only consider the combinations that he would prefer.
We can assume:

For a given grade, he prefers a combination with more free time to one with less free time. Therefore, even though both A and B in Figure 3.6 correspond to a grade of 84, Alexei prefers A because it gives him more free time.
Similarly, if two combinations both have 20 hours of free time, he prefers the one with a higher grade.
But compare points A and D in the table. Would Alexei prefer D (low grade, plenty of time) or A (higher grade, less time)? One way to find out would be to ask him.


utilityA numerical indicator of the value that one places on an outcome, such that higher valued outcomes will be chosen over lower valued ones when both are feasible.

Suppose he says he is indifferent between A and D, meaning he would feel equally satisfied with either outcome. We say that these two outcomes would give Alexei the same utility. And we know that he prefers A to B, so B provides lower utility than A or D.
A systematic way to graph Alexeis preferences would be to start by looking for all of the combinations that give him the same utility as A and D. We could ask Alexei another question: Imagine that you could have the combination at A (15 hours of free time, 84 points). How many points would you be willing to sacrifice for an extra hour of free time? Suppose that after due consideration, he answers nine. Then we know that he is indifferent between A and E (16 hours, 75 points). Then we could ask the same question about combination E, and so on until point D. Eventually we could draw up a table like the one in Figure 3.6. Alexei is indifferent between A and E, between E and F, and so on, which means he is indifferent between all of the combinations from A to D.

indifference curveA curve of the points which indicate the combinations of goods that provide a given level of utility to the individual.

The combinations in the table are plotted in Figure 3.6, and joined together to form a downward-sloping curve, called an indifference curve, which joins together all of the combinations that provide equal utility or satisfaction.

Other indifference curves


Indifference curves can be drawn through any point in the diagram, to show other points giving the same utility. We can construct other curves starting from B or C in the same way as before, by finding out which combinations give the same amount of utility.




If you look at the three curves drawn in Figure 3.6, you can see that the one through A gives higher utility than the one through B. The curve through C gives the lowest utility of the three. To describe preferences we dont need to know the exact utility of each option; we only need to know which combinations provide more or less utility than others.

consumption goodA good or service that satisfies the needs of consumers over a short period.

The curves we have drawn capture our typical assumptions about peoples preferences between two goods. In other models, these will often be consumption goods such as food or clothing, and we refer to the person as a consumer. In our model of a students preferences, the goods are final grade and free time. Notice that:

Indifference curves slope downward due to trade-offs: If you are indifferent between two combinations, the combination that has more of one good must have less of the other good.
Higher indifference curves correspond to higher utility levels: As we move up and to the right in the diagram, further away from the origin, we move to combinations with more of both goods.
Indifference curves are usually smooth: Small changes in the amounts of goods dont cause big jumps in utility.
Indifference curves do not cross: Why? See Exercise 3.3.
As you move to the right along an indifference curve, it becomes flatter.


marginal rate of substitution (MRS)The trade-off that a person is willing to make between two goods. At any point, this is the slope of the indifference curve. See also: marginal rate of transformation.

To understand the last property in the list, look at Alexeis indifference curves, which are plotted again in Figure 3.7. If he is at A, with 15 hours of free time and a grade of 84, he would be willing to sacrifice 9 percentage points for an extra hour of free time, taking him to E (remember that he is indifferent between A and E). We say that his marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between grade points and free time at A is nine; it is the reduction in his grade that would keep Alexeis utility constant following a one-hour increase of free time.
We have drawn the indifference curves as becoming gradually flatter because it seems reasonable to assume that the more free time and the lower the grade he has, the less willing he will be to sacrifice further percentage points in return for free time, so his MRS will be lower. InFigure 3.7 we have calculated the MRS at each combination along the indifference curve. You can see that, when Alexei has more free time and a lower grade, the MRSthe number of percentage points he would give up to get an extra hour of free timegradually falls.

Alexeis indifference curves


The diagram shows three indifference curves for Alexei. The curve furthest to the left offers the lowest satisfaction.














Point A


At A, he has 15 hours of free time and his grade is 84.














Alexei is indifferent between A and E


He would be willing to move from A to E, giving up 9 percentage points for an extra hour of free time. His marginal rate of substitution is 9. The indifference curve is steep at A.














Alexei is indifferent between H and D


At H he is only willing to give up 4 points for an extra hour of free time. His MRS is 4. As we move down the indifference curve, the MRS diminishes, because points become scarce relative to free time. The indifference curve becomes flatter.














All combinations with 15 hours of free time


Look at the combinations with 15 hours of free time. On the lowest curve the grade is low, and the MRS is small. Alexei would be willing to give up only a few points for an hour of free time. As we move up the vertical line the indifference curves are steeper: the MRS increases.














All combinations with a grade of 54


Now look at all the combinations with a grade of 54. On the curve furthest to the left, free time is scarce, and the MRS is high. As we move to the right along the red line he is less willing to give up points for free time. The MRS decreasesthe indifference curves get flatter.




The MRS is just the slope of the indifference curve, and it falls as we move to the right along the curve. If you think about moving from one point to another in Figure 3.7, you can see that the indifference curves get flatter if you increase the amount of free time, and steeper if you increase the grade. When free time is scarce relative to grade points, Alexei is less willing to sacrifice an hour for a higher grade: his MRS is high and his indifference curve is steep.
As the analysis in Figure 3.7 shows, if you move up the vertical line through 15 hours, the indifference curves get steeper: the MRS increases. For a given amount of free time, Alexei is willing to give up more grade points for an additional hour when he has a lot of points compared to when he has few (for example, if he was in danger of failing the course). By the time you reach A, where his grade is 84, the MRS is high; grade points are so plentiful here that he is willing to give up 9 percentage points for an extra hour of free time.
Leibniz: Indifference curves and the marginal rate of substitution
You can see the same effect if you fix the grade and vary the amount of free time. If you move to the right along the horizontal line for a grade of 54, the MRS becomes lower at each indifference curve. As free time becomes more plentiful, Alexei becomes less and less willing to give up grade points for more time.


Exercise 3.3 Why indifference curves never cross
In the diagram below, IC1 is an indifference curve joining
all the combinations that give the same level of utility as A.
Combination B is not on IC1.













Does combination B give higher or lower utility than combination A? How do you know?
Draw a sketch of the diagram, and add another indifference curve, IC2, that goes through B and crosses IC1. Label the point at which they cross as C.
Combinations B and C are both on IC2. What does that imply about their levels of utility?
Combinations C and A are both on IC1. What does that imply about their levels of utility?
According to your answers to (3) and (4), how do the levels of utility at combinations A and B compare?
Now compare your answers to (1) and (5), and explain how you know that indifference curves can never cross.



Exercise 3.4 Your marginal rate of substitution
Imagine that you are offered a job at the end of your university course with a salary per hour (after taxes) of 12.50. Your future employer then says that you will work for 40 hours per week leaving you with 128 hours of free time per week. You tell a friend: at that wage, 40 hours is exactly what I would like.

Draw a diagram with free time on the horizontal axis and weekly pay on the vertical axis, and plot the combination of hours and the wage corresponding to your job offer, calling it A. Assume you need about 10 hours a day for sleeping and eating, so you may want to draw the horizontal axis with 70 hours at the origin.
Now draw an indifference curve so that A represents the hours you would have chosen yourself.
Now imagine you were offered another job requiring 45 hours of work per week. Use the indifference curve you have drawn to estimate the level of weekly pay that would make you indifferent between this and the original offer.
Do the same for another job requiring 35 hours of work per week. What level of weekly pay would make you indifferent between this and the original offer?
Use your diagram to estimate your marginal rate of substitution between pay and free time at A.



Question 3.4 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 3.6 shows Alexeis indifference curves for free time and final grade. Which of the following is true?

Alexei prefers C to B because at C he has more free time.
Alexei is indifferent between the grade of 84 with 15 hours of free time, and the grade of 50 with 20 hours of free time.
Alexei prefers D to C, because at D he has the same grade and more free time.
At G, Alexei is willing to give up 2 hours of free time for 10 extra grade points.


The indifference curve through C is lower than that through B. Hence Alexei prefers B to C.
A, where Alexei has the grade of 84 and 15 hours of free time, and D, where Alexei has the grade of 50 with 20 hours of free time, are on
the same indifference curve.
At D Alexei has the same amount of free time but a higher grade.
The opposite trade-off is true: going from G to D, Alexei is willing to give up 10 grade points for 2 extra hours of free time. Going from G to E, he is willing to give up 2 hours of free time for 15 extra grade points.



Question 3.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
What is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)?

The ratio of the amounts of the two goods at a point on the indifference curve.
The amount of one good that the consumer is willing to trade for one unit of the other.
The change in the consumers utility when one good is substituted for another.
The slope of the indifference curve.


The marginal rate of substitution represents the ratio of the trade-off at the margin, in other words, how much of one good the consumer is willing to sacrifice for one extra unit of the other.
This is the definition of the marginal rate of substitution.
The MRS is the amount of one good that can be substituted for one unit of the other while keeping utility constant.
The slope of the indifference curve represents the marginal rate of substitution: the trade-off between two goods that keeps utility constant.
