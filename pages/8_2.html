8.1 Buying and selling: Demand and supply

willingness to pay (WTP)An indicator of how much a person values a good, measured by the maximum amount he or she would pay to acquire a unit of the good. See also: willingness to accept.

In Unit 7 we considered the case of a good produced and sold by just one firm. There was one seller with many buyers in the market for that product. In this unit, we look at markets where many buyers and sellers interact, and show how the competitive market price is determined by both the preferences of consumers and the costs of suppliers. When there are many firms producing the same product, each firms decisions are affected by the behaviour of competing firms, as well as consumers.
For a simple model of a market with many buyers and sellers, think about the potential for trade in second-hand copies of a recommended textbook for a university economics course. Demand for the book comes from students who are about to begin the course, and they will differ in their willingness to pay (WTP). No one will pay more than the price of a new copy in the campus bookshop. Below that, students WTP may depend on how hard they work, how important they think the book is, and on their available resources for buying books.

Often when you buy something you dont need to think about your exact willingness to pay. You just decide whether to pay the asking price. But WTP is a useful concept for buyers in online auctions, such as eBay.
If you want to bid for an item, one way to do it is to set a maximum bid equal to your WTP, which will be kept secret from other bidders: this article explains how to do it on eBay. eBay will place bids automatically on your behalf until you are the highest bidder, or until your maximum is reached. You will win the auction if, and only if, the highest bid is less than or equal to your WTP.


willingness to accept (WTA)The reservation price of a potential seller, who will be willing to sell a unit only for a price at least this high. See also: willingness to pay.

Figure 8.1 shows the demand curve. As in Unit 7, we line up all the consumers in order of willingness to pay, highest first. The first student is willing to pay $20, the 20th $10, and so on. For any price, P, the graph tells you how many students would be willing to buy: it is the number whose WTP is at or above P.

The demand curve represents the WTP of buyers; similarly, supply depends on the sellers willingness to accept (WTA) money in return for books.

reservation priceThe lowest price at which someone is willing to sell a good (keeping the good is the potential sellers reservation option). See also: reservation option.

The supply of second-hand books comes from students who have previously completed the course, who will differ in the amount they are willing to acceptthat is, their reservation price. Recall from Unit 5 that Angela was willing to enter into a contract with Bruno only if it gave her at least as much utility as her reservation option (no work and survival rations); here the reservation price of a potential seller represents the value to her of keeping the book, and she will only be willing to sell for a price at least that high. Poorer students (who are keen to sell so that they can afford other books) and those no longer studying economics may have lower reservation prices. Again, online auctions like eBay allow sellers to specify their WTA.

If you sell an item on eBay you can set a reserve price, which will not be disclosed to the bidders. This article explains eBay reserve prices. You are telling eBay that the item should not be sold unless there is a bid at (or above) that price. So the reserve price should correspond to your WTA. If no one bids your WTA, the item will not be sold.


supply curveThe curve that shows the number of units of output that would be produced at any given price. For a market, it shows the total quantity that all firms together would produce at any given price.

We can draw a supply curve by lining up the sellers in order of their reservation prices (their WTAs): see Figure 8.2. We put the sellers who are most willing to sellthose who have the lowest reservation pricesfirst, so the graph of reservation prices slopes upward.

Reservation price


The first seller has a reservation price of $2, and will sell at any price above that.














The 20th seller


The 20th seller will accept $7














The 40th seller


 and the 40th sellers reservation price is $12.














Supply curves slope upward


If you choose a particular price, say $10, the graph shows how many books would be supplied (Q) at that price: in this case, it is 32. The supply curve slopes upward: the higher the price, the more students will be willing to sell.




For any price, the supply curve shows the number of students willing to sell at that pricethat is, the number of books that will be supplied to the market. Notice that we have drawn the supply and demand curves as straight lines for simplicity. In practice they are more likely to be curves, with the exact shape depending on how valuations of the book vary among the students.

Question 8.1 Choose the correct answer(s)
As a student representative, one of your roles is to organize a second-hand textbook market between the current and former first-year students. After a survey, you estimate the demand and supply curves to be the ones shown in Figures 8.1 and 8.2. For example, you estimate that pricing the book at $7 would lead to a supply of 20 books and a demand of 26 books. Which of the following statements is correct?

A rumour that the textbook may be required again in Year 2 would change the supply curve, shifting it upwards.
Doubling the price to $14 would double the supply.
A rumour that the textbook may no longer be on the reading list for the first-year students would change the demand curve, shifting it upwards.
Demand would double if the price were reduced sufficiently.


The rumour would make the former first-year students less willing to sell. Their WTAs would rise, shifting the supply curve upwards. Equivalently, the number of students willing to supply their book at each price would be lower.
From the supply curve, we can see that supply would double to 40 if the price were increased to $12.
The rumour would shift the demand curve downwards.
The maximum demand attainable is 40 at zero price.



Exercise 8.1 Selling strategies and reservation prices
Consider three possible methods to sell a car that you own:

Advertise it in the local newspaper.
Take it to a car auction.
Offer it to a second-hand car dealer.


Would your reservation price be the same in each case? Why?
If you used the first method, would you advertise it at your reservation price?
Which method do you think would result in the highest sale price?
Which method would you choose?
