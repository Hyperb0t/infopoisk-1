13.5 How households cope with fluctuations
Economies fluctuate between good and bad times. So far we have studied industrialized economies, but this is equally true in economies based on agriculture. Figure 13.9a illustrates fluctuations in production in the largely agrarian British economy between 1550 and 1700. Just as we divided GDP into different components from the expenditure side, we can also divide it into different sectors on the production side. Figure 13.9a shows the growth rate of real GDP and of the three main sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. Follow the analysis in Figure 13.9a to see how the agricultural sector drove fluctuations in GDP.

Agriculture


Clearly the agricultural sector is much more volatile than other sectors.

Industry


In this period the average difference in the output of the agricultural sector from one year to the next is three times larger than that of the industrial sector

Services


 and more than 10 times larger than that of the services sector.

Agriculture drove fluctuations in GDP


Between 1552 and 1553, the agricultural sector expanded by 41% and GDP rose by 17%. In the next year the agricultural sector contracted by 16% and the economy shrank by 8%.

Figure 13.9b shows the growth rates of real GDP and agriculture in India since 1960. In 1960 agriculture comprised 43% of the economy, which had declined to 17% in 2014. Partly due to modern farming methods, agriculture in modern India is not as volatile as it was in Britain before 1700. But it remains nearly twice as volatile as GDP as a whole.

shockAn exogenous change in some of the fundamental data used in a model.

To help us to think about the costs and causes of economic fluctuations, we begin with an agrarian economy. In an economy based on agricultural production, the weatheralong with war and diseaseis a major cause of good and bad years. The term shock is used in economics to refer to an unexpected event, for example, extreme weather or a war. As we know, people think about the future and usually they anticipate that unpredictable events may occur. They also act on these beliefs. In a modern economy, this is the basis of the insurance industry. In an agrarian economy, households also anticipate that both bad luck and good harvests can occur.
How do households cope with fluctuations that can cut their income in half from one season to the next?
We can distinguish between two situations:

Good or bad fortune strikes the household: For example, when disease affects a familys animals, or when a family member who plays an important role in farming is injured.
Good or bad fortune strikes the economy as a whole: For example, when drought, disease, floods, a war, or an earthquake affects a whole area.

Household shocks

self-insuranceSaving by a household in order to be able to maintain its consumption when there is a temporary fall in income or need for greater expenditure.co-insuranceA means of pooling savings across households in order for a household to be able to maintain consumption when it experiences a temporary fall in income or the need for greater expenditure.

People use two strategies to deal with shocks that are specific to their household:3

Self-insurance: Households that encounter an unusually high income in some period will save, so that when their luck reverses, they can spend their savings. As we saw in Unit 10, they may also borrow in bad times if they can, depending on how credit-constrained they are. It is called self-insurance because other households are not involved.
Co-insurance: Households that have been fortunate during a particular period can help a household hit by bad luck. Sometimes this is done among members of extended families or among friends and neighbours. Since the mid-twentieth century, particularly in richer countries, co-insurance has taken the form of citizens paying taxes, which are then used to support individuals who are temporarily out of work, called unemployment benefits.


altruismThe willingness to bear a cost in order to benefit somebody else.

Informal co-insurance among family and friends is based on both reciprocity and trust: you are willing to help those who have helped you in the past, and you trust the people who you helped to do the same in return. Altruism towards those in need is also usually involved, although co-insurance can work without it.4
These strategies reflect two important aspects of household preferences:

People prefer a smooth pattern of consumption: As we saw in Unit 10, they dislike consumption that fluctuates as a result of bad or good shocks such as injury or good harvests. So they will self-insure.
Households are not solely selfish: They are willing to provide support to each other to help smooth the effect of good and bad luck. They often trust others to do the same, even when they do not have a way of enforcing this. Altruistic and reciprocal preferences remain important even when co-insurance takes the form of a tax-supported unemployment benefit, because these are among the motives for supporting the public policies in question.

Economy-wide shocks
Co-insurance is less effective if the bad shock hits everyone at the same time. When there is a drought, flood, or earthquake, it is more difficult for an agrarian economy to protect the wellbeing of the people who are affected. For example, it is not usually possible to store produce from a bumper harvest long enough to get through the next bad harvest, which may take several years to arrive.
But when these shocks hit, co-insurance may be even more necessary, as community survival requires that less badly hit households help the worst-hit households. In farming economies of the past that were based in volatile climates, people practised co-insurance based on trust, reciprocity, and altruism. These are norms, like the fairness norm we discussed in Unit 4, and they probably emerged and persisted because they helped people to survive in these regions that were often hit by bad weather shocks. Recent research suggests that they seem to have persisted even after climate had become largely unimportant for economic activity.
The evidence for this is that people in the regions with high year-to-year variability in rainfall and temperature during the past 500 years now display high levels of trust, and have more modern day co-insurance institutions such as unemployment benefit payments and government assistance for the disabled and poor.5

Exercise 13.5 Health insurance

Think about the health insurance system in your country. Is this an example of co-insurance or self-insurance?
Can you think of other examples of both co-insurance and self-insurance? In each case, consider what kinds of shocks are being insured against and how the scheme is financed.



Question 13.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 13.9a plots the growth rate of real GDP, as well as the growth rates of the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors between 1550 and 1700 in Britain.
Which of the following statements can be deduced from the graph?

The average growth rate of the agricultural sector was higher than that of the service sector for the period shown.
The growth rate of the industrial sector was more volatile than that of the service sector.
The agricultural sector largely drove fluctuations in GDP.
The recession around 1560 was caused by contractions in all three sectors.


This cannot be deduced from the graph. One can only compare the level of fluctuations.
The peaks are higher and the troughs deeper in the industrial sector.
The peaks and troughs in GDP follow those in agriculture very closely.
Actually, the industrial sector grew while the agricultural sector shrank. The service sector was more or less unchanged. It is the larger size of the agricultural sector that led to the overall contraction of the economy.
