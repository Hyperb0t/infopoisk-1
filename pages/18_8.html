18.7 Winners and losers in the very long run and along the way
In our example of the US and China, the short-run effect of trade was to raise the profits of US employers while depressing the wages of US workers. This would provide US employers with incentives to invest more in building additional capacity to produce aircraft. Our analysis of wages and employment in the long run (in Unit 16) provides a lens for us to study what will happen next.
Specializing in the production of the good in which it has a comparative advantage increases the productivity of US labour (workers have moved from producing electronics to producing aircraft, where they are more productive). This shifts up the price-setting curve and output per worker. So, in this respect, specialization according to comparative advantage is similar to technological progress as analysed in Unit 16. It may be worth reviewing the key concepts in that unit before continuing on here.
Use the analysis in Figure 18.21 to follow through the impact effect and adjustment process. We start with the US wage-setting curve and the price-setting curve before specialization and trade with China. The economy starts at point A with unemployment at the long-run rate of 6%.

Unemployment at the long-run rate


The economy starts at point A (U = 6%).














The US specializes in the production of aircraft


It has a comparative advantage. By specializing in the good it is relatively best at, this increases the average productivity of US labour, shifting up output per worker and therefore, the price-setting curve.














Workers producing consumer electronics are laid off


US consumers are now buying their DVD players from China. Some are hired in producing aircraft, but not all, because productive capacity in that sector is limited. The economy moves from point A to point B and unemployment rises.














US aircraft manufacturing firms are making large profits


They expect this will continue in the future. They build new production capacity, expanding the demand for labour and re-employing the former electronics workers. The economy moves from point B to point C, and unemployment falls to 4% below its original level.














Increased demand for labour


The demand increases workers bargaining power. Wages increase. This process stops when the economy has come to the new intersection of the price- and wage-setting curves at point D.














The wage-setting curve


It may also shift if workers demand more generous unemployment benefits because of the increased job turnover due to the effects of trade. If it shifts a lot, specialization might imply a reduction in total employment. For example, at point E in the figure, unemployment is higher than the original long-run rate of 6%.














Specialization and unemployment


However, if there were only a modest shift in the wage-setting curve, employment would have risen as a result of specialization, as shown by point F.




When the economy has come to the new intersection of the price- and wage-setting curves, will the US economy now employ more or fewer workers than before?
As shown in the analysis in Figure 18.21, the answer depends on the change to the wage-setting curve. Historically, in many countries, integration into the world economy was accompanied by unemployment in some sectors of the economy. In addition, economic fluctuations due to international price changes produced variations in cyclical unemployment. The result was an increase in voters demands for more adequate unemployment insurance policies, and a strengthening of employment protection and other policies to protect households from shocks to income and employment. Voters supported these policies for the same reason that households seek to smooth consumption. These effects would shift the wage-setting curve up.

welfare stateA set of government policies designed to provide improvements in the welfare of citizens by assisting with income smoothing (for example, unemployment benefits and pensions).

As we saw in Unit 17, in the era after the Second World War, many countries integrated their economies into the world economy and at the same time developed income-smoothing policies, commonly termed the welfare state. In Nordic countries, for example, trade unions agreed to unimpeded imports. In return they won support for unemployed workers, and policies to retrain workers displaced by imports increased.
The rapid growth in world trade among the high-income countries following the Second World War took place alongside the development of the welfare state and falling inequality. Unemployment remained low during this period, as we saw in Units 16 and 17. Specialization in this period was based on trade among quite similar countriesUS and western European economies, for exampleand it rested to a considerable extent on economies of scale and agglomeration economies. Much of it was so-called intra-industry trade where countries were trading similar goods (exporting and importing different kinds of cars and commercial vehicles, for example, as in Exercise 18.7).
The process of specialization created winners and losersincluding winner companies like BMW and Ford, and entire winner industries like machine tools in Germany and aircraft production in the US, benefiting owners and employees alike. And, unlike specialization based on factor endowments, trade based on economies of scale does not separate out the winners and losers according to the factor of production that is the main endowment on which a persons income depends (for example labour or capital).
The renewed growth of global integration following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening up of China to trade from the early 1990s has been accompanied by rising inequality in many high-income countries, along with geographically concentrated job losses in labour markets affected by imports from China. For these particular displaced workers it was not much reassurance to know that a new equilibrium would eventually be reached in which workers would on average be better off.
With the help of the labour market model in Figure 18.21, we can see the common features of a trade shock and a technology shock. In Section 16.7, we contrasted the benefits of these shocks in the very long run with the costly adjustment as jobs are lost before new ones are created in different industries (and locations). The evidence reported there from the China shock that began in the early 1990s highlighted that job losses were concentrated geographically and persisted for decades. Tennessee, which specialized in furniture, suffered massive, long-lasting job losses, while nearby Alabama, which produced goods that were not exported by China, did not.
Not all countries were affected in the same way by the China trade shock. Recent research shows that in Germany, the new opportunities to trade with low wage countries in eastern Europe arising after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and to trade with China, slowed down the loss of manufacturing jobs. Although jobs in industries competing with imports shrank, jobs in exporting industries were about the same in 2014 as in 1997. One explanation for the difference between the effects in China and the US is that among the capital-intensive countries, Germany was more successful than the US in expanding its markets in China. Comparing Germany and the US, Germanys specialization in exports of machine tools, other capital goods (for use in Chinese factories), and transport equipment matched the demand from rapidly industrializing China.3

Question 18.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 18.21 is the long-run labour market model for the US as a result of specialization according to its comparative advantage.
The US has a comparative advantage in the production of capital-intensive aircraft, while China, its trade partner, has a comparative advantage in the production of labour-intensive consumer electronics. Before trade, the German labour market equilibrium is at A. Which of the following statements are correct?

As a result of specialization, at first both worker productivity and the total employment level rise.
With the rise in productivity, the firms expand employment resulting in a lower unemployment rate.
With lower unemployment, workers demand higher wages for high effort, resulting in a higher price-setting curve.
The wage-setting curve rises if workers demand unemployment insurance as a result of globalization. Then the long-run employment level is unambiguously lower than at A.


The productivity rises as production shifts to more capital-intensive good. However this means that fewer workers are employed per unit capital, resulting in a fall in the total employment. On the diagram the economy moves from A to B.
With more productive labour the firms invest in productive capacity, re-employing former consumer electronics workers.
Yes, workers move along and up the wage-setting curve until it meets the higher price-setting curve.
If the rise in the wage-setting curve is modest then the long-run employment level may be higher than at A (for example at F).
