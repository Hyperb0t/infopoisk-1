14.8 The governments finances

government debtThe sum of all the bonds the government has sold over the years to finance its deficits, minus the ones that have matured.

From the paradox of thrift, we learned that in a recession, it is counterproductive for the government to offset the automatic stabilization of the economy. We have also learned that using a fiscal stimulus to boost aggregate demand in a deep recession can be justified, under conditions in which the multiplier is greater than one. So why are stimulus policies often followed by policies of austerity? The answer is the governments debt. To understand why, we turn to the governments revenue and its expenditure.
Revenue
Governments raise revenue in the form of income taxes and taxes on spending, often called Value Added Tax (VAT) or sales tax. They also raise money from a variety of other sources including taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco, and petroland on wealth, including through inheritance taxes.
Expenditure
Government expenditure includes health, education, and defence, as well as public investment such as roads and schools.
Government revenue is also used to fund social security transfers, which include unemployment benefits, pensions, and disability benefits. The government also has to pay interest on its debt. Transfers and interest payments are paid out of government revenues, but they do not count in G because the government is not spending money on goods or services.
Government primary deficit

primary deficitThe government deficit (its revenue minus its expenditure) excluding interest payments on its debt. See also: government debt.

The government deficit, excluding interest payments on its debt, is called theprimary budget deficit and is measured by G  T, where T is tax revenue minus transfers (assumed to be tY in the multiplier model with a proportional tax rate, t). If the initial situation is one of a zero primary deficit, then it automatically worsens in a business cycle downturn. When the downturn reverses, the governments primary budget deficit will decline, and in the upswing, the government will have higher revenues than spending.
When there is a budget deficit, this means the government must borrow to cover the gap between its revenue and its expenditure. The government borrows by selling bonds. Firms and households buy the bonds. Households usually buy them indirectly, because they are bought by pension funds, from which households buy pensions. The sale of bonds adds to the governments debt.
Because of the existence of global financial markets, foreigners can also buy home country bonds. Government bonds are attractive to investors because they pay a fixed interest rate and because they are generally considered a safe investment: the default risk on government bonds is usually low. Investors are likely to want to hold a mixture of safe and risky assets, and government bonds are normally at the safe end of the spectrum.

sovereign debt crisisA situation in which government bonds come to be considered so risky that the government may not be able to continue to borrow. If so, the government cannot spend more than the tax revenue they receive.

A sovereign debt crisis is a situation in which government bonds come to be considered risky. Such crises are not uncommon in developing and emerging economies, but they are rare in advanced economies. However, in 2010, there was an increase in interest rates on bonds issued by the Irish, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese governments, which was a signal of a sharp increase in default riskthe likelihood that the government would be unable to make the required payments on its debt. It marked the start of the Eurozone crisis. Governments of countries experiencing a sovereign debt crisis may have no alternative to austerity policies if they can no longer borrow, because in this case they cannot spend more than the tax revenue they receive.
A large stock of debt relative to GDP can be a problem because, like a household, the government has to pay interest on its debt and it has to raise revenue to pay the interest, which may require raising tax rates. However, governments are not like households in that there is no point at which they need to have paid off all their stock of debtas one set of bonds matures, governments will typically issue more bonds, maintaining a stock of debt (this is called rolling over debt, which firms also typically do to finance their operations). Indeed, because government bonds are generally seen as a safe asset outside periods of crisis, there is usually demand for government debt from private investors. As the long-run data for the UK in Figure 14.15 makes clear, there are no general rules about how much debt is safe for governments to have.

Figure 14.15 shows the path of UK government debt from 1700 to 2014. The level of indebtedness of a government is measured in relation to the size of the economy, that is, as a percentage of GDP. The two big upward spikes in the British debt to GDP ratio in the twentieth century were caused by the need for the government to borrow to finance the war effort.
Financial crises also raise government debt. Governments borrow both to bail out failing banks and to support the economy in the lengthy recessions that follow financial crises. The UKs debt-to-GDP ratio rapidly doubled to more than 80% after the 2008 global financial crisis.
Note also that, although the UK government emerged from the Second World War with a very high level of debt, it fell rapidly in the following decades: from 260% of GDP to 50% by the 1980s. Why? The British government ran a primary budget surplus in every year except one from 1948 until 1973, which helped to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. But the ratio may also fall even when there is a primary budget deficit, as long as the growth rate of the economy is higher than the interest rate. During the period of rapid reduction of the British debt ratio, in addition to the primary surpluses, there was moderate growth, low nominal interest rates set by the government, and moderate inflation.
Why does inflation help a country reduce its debt ratio? Because the face value of government bonds (the level of debt) is denominated in nominal terms. For instance, the issue of 10-year bonds in 1950 would promise to repay 1 million in 1960. So if inflation was moderately high during the 1950s, then nominal GDP would be growing fast while that 1 million owed in 1960 would remain constant, meaning the debt would have shrunk relative to GDP. As we discuss further in Unit 15, inflation reduces the real value of debt.
For many advanced economies, there have been extended periods in which the growth rate has been higher than the interest rate. Brad DeLong, an economist, has pointed out that this has been true for the US for almost all of the last 125 years.11

Exercise 14.9 Efficiency and fairness
How would you use the criteria of Pareto improvement and fairness to evaluate the use of stimulus policies and bank bailouts following the global financial crisis of 20072008?
Hint: you might want to look back at Sections 5.2 and 5.3 in Unit 5, where the concepts are explained.

Countries with aging populations have demographic trends that imply upward pressure on the debt-to-GDP ratio, because the proportion of government revenue spent on state pensions, healthcare, and social care for the elderly will increase. Many governments and voters are facing a difficult choice: do they limit benefits, or put up taxes?12
The lessons from our discussion of fiscal policy and government debt are:

Automatic stabilizers play a useful role: Over the course of the business cycle, they contribute to economic wellbeing.
If additional fiscal stimulus is used, this ought to be reversed later: This reversal can take place when the economy is growing again. If a stimulus is not reversed, the government debt-to-GDP ratio will rise.
Financial crises and wars increase government debt.
Inflation reduces the debt burden of the government: Likewise, deflation increases it.
An ever-increasing debt ratio is unsustainable: But there is no rule that says exactly how much debt is problematic.
If the growth rate is below the interest rate, it is necessary to run primary government surpluses as they stabilize and reduce the debt ratio: Attempting to reduce the debt ratio rapidly, however, is counterproductive if it depresses growth.

To get a feel for the effects of policy interventions, The Economist provides a modelling tool to experiment as a hypothetical policymaker. Try different combinations of primary budget balance, growth rate, nominal interest rate, and inflation rate as methods of preventing the debt ratio from continuously rising in a country of your choice.
