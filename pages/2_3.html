2.2 Economic models: How to see more by looking at less
What happens in the economy depends on what millions of people do, and how their decisions affect the behaviour of others. It would be impossible to understand the economy by describing every detail of how they act and interact. We need to be able to stand back and look at the big picture. To do this, we use models.
To create an effective model we need to distinguish between the essential features of the economy that are relevant to the question we want to answer, which should be included in the model, and unimportant details that can be ignored.























Models come in many forms. You have seen three of them already in Figures 1.5, 1.8 and 1.12 in Unit 1.
        





flowA quantity measured per unit of time, such as annual income or hourly wage.

Models come in many formsand you have seen three of them already in Figures 1.5, 1.8 and 1.12 in Unit 1. For example, Figure 1.12 illustrated that economic interactions involve flows of goods (for example when you buy a washing machine), services (when you purchase haircuts or bus rides), and also people (when you spend a day working for an employer).
Figure 1.12 was a diagrammatic model illustrating the flows that occur within the economy, and between the economy and the biosphere. The model is not realisticthe economy and the biosphere dont look anything like itbut it nevertheless illustrates the relationships among them. The fact that the model omits many detailsand in this sense is unrealisticis a feature of the model, not a bug.
Malthus explanation of why improvements in technology could not raise living standards was also based on a model: a simple description of the relationships between income and population.
Some economists have used physical models to illustrate and explore how the economy works. For his 1891 PhD thesis at Yale University, Irving Fisher designed a hydraulic apparatus (Figure 2.2) to represent flows in the economy. It consisted of interlinked levers and floating cisterns of water to show how the prices of goods depend on the amount of each good supplied, the incomes of consumers, and how much they value each good. The whole apparatus stops moving when the water levels in the cisterns are the same as the level in the surrounding tank. When it comes to rest, the position of a partition in each cistern corresponds to the price of each good. For the next 25 years he would use the contraption to teach students how markets work.

How models are used in economics
Fishers study of the economy illustrates how all models are used:

First he built a model to capture the elements of the economy that he thought mattered for the determination of prices.
Then he used the model to show how interactions between these elements could result in a set of prices that did not change.
Finally he conducted experiments with the model to discover the effects of changes in economic conditions: for example, if the supply of one of the goods increased, what would happen to its price? What would happen to the prices of all of the other goods?

Irving Fishers doctoral dissertation represented the economy as a big tank of water, but he wasnt an eccentric inventor. On the contrary, his machine was described by Paul Samuelson, himself one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, as the greatest doctoral dissertation in economics ever written. Fisher went on to become one of the most highly regarded economists of the twentieth century, and his contributions formed the basis of modern theories of borrowing and lending that we will describe in Unit10.

equilibriumA model outcome that is self-perpetuating. In this case, something of interest does not change unless an outside or external force is introduced that alters the models description of the situation.

Fishers machine illustrates an important concept in economics. An equilibrium is a situation that is self-perpetuating, meaning that something of interest does not change unless an outside or external force for change is introduced that alters the models description of the situation. Fishers hydraulic apparatus represented equilibrium in his model economy by equalizing water levels, which represented constant prices.

subsistence levelThe level of living standards (measured by consumption or income) such that the population will not grow or decline.

We will use the concept of equilibrium to explain prices in later units, but we will also apply it to the Malthusian model. An income at subsistence level is an equilibrium because, just like differences in the water levels in the various cisterns in Fishers machine, movements away from subsistence income are self-correcting: they automatically lead back to subsistence income as population rises.
Note that equilibrium means that one or more things in the model are constant. It does not need to mean that nothing changes. For example, we might see an equilibrium in which GDP or prices are increasing, but at a constant rate.
Although it is unlikely that you will build a hydraulic model for yourself, you will work with many existing models on paper or on a screen, and sometimes create your own models of the economy.
When we build a model, the process follows these steps:

We construct a simplified description of the conditions under which people take actions.
Then we describe in simple terms what determines the actions that people take.
We determine how each of their actions affects each other.
We determine the outcome of these actions. This is often an equilibrium (something is constant).
Finally, we try to get more insight by studying what happens to certain variables when conditions change.


Economic models
A good model has four attributes:

It is clear: It helps us better understand something important.
It predicts accurately: Its predictions are consistent with evidence.
It improves communication: It helps us to understand what we agree (and disagree) about.
It is useful: We can use it to find ways to improve how the economy works.


Economic models often use mathematical equations and graphs as well as words and pictures.
Mathematics is part of the language of economics, and can help us to communicate our statements about models precisely to others. Much of the knowledge of economics, however, cannot be expressed by using mathematics alone. It requires clear descriptions, using standard definitions of terms.
We will use mathematics as well as words to describe models, usually in the form of graphs. If you want, you will also be able to look at some of the equations behind the graphs. Just look for the references to our Leibniz features in the margins.
Introducing the Leibnizes
A model starts with some assumptions or hypotheses about how people behave, and often gives us predictions about what we will observe in the economy. Gathering data on the economy, and comparing it with what a model predicts, helps us to decide whether the assumptions we made when we built the modelwhat to include, and what to leave outwere justified.
Governments, central banks, corporations, trade unions, and anyone else who makes policies or forecasts use some type of simplified model.
Bad models can result in disastrous policies, as we will see later. To have confidence in a model, we need to see whether it is consistent with evidence.
We will see that our economic models of the vicious circle of Malthusian subsistence living standards and the permanent technological revolution pass this testeven though they leave many questions unanswered.

Exercise 2.1 Designing a model
For a country (or city) of your choice, look up a map of the railway or public transport network.
Much like economic models, maps are simplified representations of reality. They include relevant information, while abstracting from irrelevant details.

How do you think the designer selected which features of reality to include in the map you have selected?
In what way is a map not like an economic model?
