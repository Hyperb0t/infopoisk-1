21.5 Matching (two-sided) markets
A market is a way of putting together people who might benefit from exchanging a good or service. Often these are potential buyers and sellers of the same commodity, such as milk, and the sides of this market are farmers supplying milk and consumers demanding it. In common usage, a market may also refer to a place such as the Fulton Fish Market that we described in Unit 8, or a place where those selling fresh vegetables, cheese, and baked goods congregate, knowing that they will encounter potential customers. In these markets, buyers do not care about who produced the fish or the milk that they buy, and sellers are similarly not concerned about who is buying, as long as someone buys their products.
Matching (two-sided) markets
People also use the term market to describe a different kind of connection, in which the people on each side of the market care whom they are matched with on the other side. This is what people have in mind when they speak about the marriage market, for example. Most of us do not get married in the way that we get a carton of milk in the grocery market. The marriage market is about getting married to a person with the combination of characteristics that you find most desirable in a spouse. Markets like these are called matching markets or two-sided markets.

matching marketA market that matches members of two distinct groups of people. Each person in the market would benefit from being connected to the right member of the other group. Also known as: two-sided market.

Alvin Roth explains how matching markets work.


In our Economist in action video, Alvin Roth, an economist who specializes in how markets are designed (and who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the subject in 2012), explains how matching markets function.1213
We have recently seen a proliferation of online platforms that connect individuals in two groups, starting with the launch of consumer-to-consumer trader eBay in 1995. These platforms make up a general-purpose technology that allows the participants to benefit from being networked together, and so are examples of two-sided markets.
Another example is Airbnb, a service that connects travellers looking for short-term apartment rentals with owners seeking to make money by making their home available while they are not living in it. Airbnb is a platform that puts the group of apartment seekers in touch with the group of apartment owners who would like to offer their apartments for rent. Tinder does the same thing for people who want to find a date for the evening. A service called JOE Network puts employers in contact with people who have recently been awarded PhDs in economics.
The CORE Project is itself a matching market, as it provides a digital platform for researchers, teachers and students in economics to connect in ways that are mutually beneficial, although it is not really a market as the services of the researchers of providing the content in the ebook and the ebook itself are provided without pay.
These matching platforms have become an important topic in economics because of the magnitude of the network connections that are now possible. But while connections on this scale are now technically feasible, there is no mechanism that will reliably bring two-sided markets into existence even if they create gains for the participants on both sides.
At an early stage, these marketsmeaning the creation of the platform, or the marketplace, or whatever it is that connects peopleface a chicken-and-egg problem. Think about Airbnb: it makes money by charging a commission on each deal that is struck. Unless there are a large number of apartment seekers consulting its website, there is no reason for an apartment owner seeking a rental to offer an apartment for rent. Without apartments to rent, Airbnb will not be able to make money, so there would be no incentive to create the platform in the first place.
A model of a two-sided matching market

strategic complementsFor two activities A and B: the more that A is performed, the greater the benefits of performing B, and the more that B is performed the greater the benefits of performing A.

In economics, these two activitiesseeking an apartment by going to Airbnbs web page, and posting ones apartment on itare termed strategic complements. This term means that the more of the first (seeking) that occurs, the more benefit there is to someone who does the second (posting); also, the more posting there is, then the more benefit there is to seeking. This is closely related to the network externalities typical of a new innovation that we discussed in the previous section, where the benefit to using Betamax increased with the number of individuals using that video format. However, in this case, the external benefit depends on how many members of the opposite group are on the platform, rather than just how many people are using the platform in total.
Figure 21.11a illustrates the chicken-and-egg problem. We begin with the number of apartments posted on Airbnb. People post their apartment because they believe that many apartment seekers will see the posting and eventually rent the apartment. If there are few people logging onto the Airbnb site (seeking), then few apartment owners will think its worth their effort to post their apartment on the site.
The posters curve shows hypothetically how many apartments would be posted in response to each possible number of apartment seekers who consult the site. As illustrated in the figure, unless more than 500 apartment seekers are going to the site, no apartment owner will post their home for rent. To see this, look at where the curve labelled posters intercepts the horizontal axis. As the number of apartment seekers (those demanding apartments) viewing the site rises beyond 500, an increasing number of owners will post their information. But there is a limit to how many people will want to rent out their home temporarily, so the posters curve flattens out as we move to the right.
The situation is similar for those seeking to rent an apartment. The number of people checking the Airbnb site depends on how many apartments are posted there. As long as more than a minimum number of apartments are posted on the site (from the figure, more than 200), then some people will look for an apartment there. This is the intercept of the seekers curve with the vertical axis. The seekers curve shows that the more apartments are posted, the more people will look.












Figure 21.11a 
A two-sided matching market: The case of Airbnb.
        















The number of apartment seekers checking the Airbnb site


This depends on the number of those posting an apartment.














The number of apartments posted by owners


This depends on the number of apartment seekers checking the Airbnb site.














Point Z


At Z, the two curves intersect. This point is a Nash equilibrium.














If no apartment seekers are consulting the site


No owners will post their apartment. Nobody doing anything is therefore another Nash equilibrium, as shown by O.














Point A


At A, the curves also intersect, but the point is not a stable equilibrium.




To see how the Airbnb market works, think about point Z in the figure. Z is a mutually consistent outcome in that:

There are 700 apartments posted, so there will be 1,800 apartment seekers.
Since there are 1,800 apartment seekers, there will be 700 apartments posted.

This means that the behaviours of the posters and the seekers is mutually consistent at point Z, and so point Z is a Nash equilibrium. If the market is at point Z, with 700 apartments posted and 1,800 apartment seekers, neither the apartment posters or seekers will want to change their behaviour.
But notice that there are two other points that also have this mutual consistency property:

There is a Nash equilibrium in which there is no Airbnb: At point O, nobody is posting an apartment on Airbnb so there is no incentive for anyone to look at the site, and because nobody is looking at the site there is no incentive for anyone to post their apartment there. This is the chicken-and-egg problem.
Point A is a mutually consistent outcome, with 250 apartments posted and 600 people seeking apartments: It is unlikely to last, however, for reasons discussed below.

To see what happens in the latter case, suppose that the number of apartment seekers unexpectedly dropped from 600 to 450. The best response for the 250 apartment owners who had previously posted their homes would then be to completely pull out of the market. If all the apartment posters drop out of the market, the remaining 450 seekers will also eventually drop out. So, if we enter the blue zone, a vicious cycle of both posters and seekers abandoning the market will ensue and the result will be no market at all, which is depicted on the diagram as point O.

unstable equilibriumAn equilibrium such that, if a shockdisturbs theequilibrium, there is asubsequenttendency to move even further away from the equilibrium.tipping pointAn unstable equilibrium at the boundary between two regions characterized by distinct movements in some variable. If the variable takes a value on one side, the variable moves in one direction; on the other, it moves in the other direction. See also: asset price bubble.

This process of adjustment away from an equilibrium is similar to the example you studied in Unit 11, about house prices and the value of durable assets. Because a small move away from point A leads to a cumulative process leading further away from A, we say that point A is unstable. A situation like point A is sometimes described as a tipping point.
Given the chicken-and-egg problem, how could Airbnb ever come into existence? Point Z is a Nash equilibrium, but how could the market ever get there?
If a sufficient number of seekers (greater than 600) somehow showed up on the site then more than 250 owners would post their apartments on the site. Or if by chance 300 owners posted their apartments, then more than 600 seekers would be motivated to check out the Airbnb site.
Figure 21.11b shows that in these cases, a virtuous cycle of both seekers and posters entering the market will take place and the number of both will grow until there are 700 posters and 1,800 seekers.

Many people seeking apartments


Consider the case where there are 876 seekers but only 300 posters, at point B.














New posters join the market


This encourages new posters to list their site (point C)














New seekers respond


This in turn attracts new apartment seekers.














A stable equilibrium


The upward spiral leads to point Z, which is a stable Nash equilibrium.














A better outcome


Comparing the three equilibria, point Z is the preferred one, better than no market, and better than the unstable equilibrium at point A.




The figure explains why we might end up either with no market at all, or with a functioning market that matches some of the 1,800 seekers with the 700 posters. To see that the second is preferable to the first, think about a particular transaction: all of those posting and seeking are doing so voluntarily, so they must all see a personal benefit in doing it. When one of the seekers is paired with a poster, both seeker and renter benefit (otherwise they would not agree). This is true for every market participant. So, having the market must be better than not having it.
The figure also shows that the market can come into existence and persist if we somehow started out with more than 600 seekers and or 250 posters. But that is a big if.
Market failures in matching markets
The economic policy challenge is to find a way to ensure that someone will create the platforms that produce benefits for participants that are sufficient to justify the cost. This is sometimes done by the public sector playing a role in creating the platform, as it did in the case of the Internet, or physical marketplaces in cities and towns. But in many cases (such as Airbnb, Tinder, and many other private platforms), the existence of a two-sided market is the haphazard result of a forward-looking individual having both the idea and the resources to launch a large, risky project.
For example, to solve the chicken-and-egg startup problem in the Airbnb market, the originator of the platform could have paid the first 250 posters to post their apartments, giving them an incentive to post on the website even when nobody was consulting the site. That could have kicked off the virtuous cycle of additional seekers and posters joining the market.
A common strategy for solving the chicken-and-egg problem is for companies to charge low or zero prices to one group of users, which then attracts the other group. For example, Adobe lets you download its PDF reader for no cost. If many people read documents as PDFs, it incentivizes document creators to pay for Adobe Acrobat, the software used to create PDF files.
While some two-sided markets, such as Wikipedia, are not designed to be money-makers, most are. And some of those who succeeded in creating widely used platforms have gained extraordinary wealth. In 2017, Facebook was valued at $245 billion and Mark Zuckerberg, who founded the company, owned 28.4% of it.
These innovation rents, unlike those associated with a new technical innovation like the spinning jenny studied in Unit 2, may not be competed away because would-be competitors face the very same chicken-and-egg problem that the successful innovators solved.
The problem is similar to the example of the strategic interaction between Plugcar and Netflex discussed earlier in this unit. There are probably many potentially mutually beneficial two-sided markets that do not exist (or do not exist yet) because of this chicken-and-egg problem. For instance, there has been little new competition in the credit card industry. It would be difficult to persuade merchants to accept a new type of card if not many shoppers carried it, and it would be difficult to encourage shoppers to carry a card that not many merchants would accept.
A catalogue of policies
The last three sections have introduced three reasons why market competition for profits cannot create an efficient innovation process by itself: external (network) effects, public goods and economies of scale. Public policies can encourage useful innovations and accelerate their diffusion to all users who may benefit. We have already mentioned the possible coordinating role of government-set standards.
In the next three sections we study two other types of policies:

Intellectual property rights: These policies support innovation rents accruing to successful innovators.
Subsidizing innovation: These policies either directly or indirectly provide basic research and low-cost dissemination of information.


Exercise 21.6 Understanding matching markets
Watch the Economist in action video of Alvin Roth. Based on the video, answer the following questions:

How are matching markets different from commodity markets?
Even if a market might be Pareto-improving, why might it not exist? Outline how the New England program helped to resolve a repugnant markets problem.
What are some aspects of the relationship between buyers and sellers that could be a source of market failure in matching markets?



Exercise 21.7 Why do curves in the matching markets model slope upwards?
Explain why both curves in the matching markets model, shown in Figure 21.11a, are upward sloping. (Hint: Remember that posting (supplying) apartments and seeking (demanding) apartments are strategic complements.)


Exercise 21.8 Mismatched posters and seekers in a matching market model
Imagine that for some reason there were 1,850 seekers and 750 posters in the matching markets model in Figure 21.11a. Locate this point in the figure. How would posters respond to the number of seekers? How would seekers respond to the number of posters? Which point would the market move to, and why?


Exercise 21.9 Chicken-and-egg
Platforms such as Airbnb, Uber, YouTube, and eBay have successfully overcome the chicken-and-egg problem mentioned above.

Pick one of the platforms mentioned above. What are the gains that this platform offers, and which other markets have they disrupted?
What factors made it possible for this platform to disrupt existing markets?



Question 21.5 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 21.11a shows a hypothetical market for Airbnb, a service that connects travellers looking for short-term apartment rentals with owners looking to rent out their home while they are away.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

There will be no posting of apartments when the number of seekers is below 200, while there will be no seeking when the number of apartments posted is below 500.
There are three stable Nash equilibria.
As long as there are more than 200 seekers and 500 apartments posted, there will always be a positive number of matches.
An initial number of 2,000 seekers and 800 posters would result in an equilibrium of 1,800 seekers and 700 apartments posted.


The numbers are the other way round: no posters when the seekers are fewer than 500 and no seekers when the posters are fewer than 200.
There are indeed three Nash equilibria, at points O, A, and Z. Two are stable (O and Z) while one is unstable (A).
For the number of seekers between 500 and 600 and the number of posters between 200 and 250, there will be a downward spiral process where the numbers on both sides of the market are driven down to zero, attaining the zero activity Nash equilibrium (point O).
There are initially some seekers and posters who cannot find a match, so they leave the market. Eventually, the market reaches an equilibrium (point Z), where all seekers and posters benefit from being in the market.
