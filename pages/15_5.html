15.4 Inflation and unemployment: Constraints and preferences
Phillips original curve, and the model in Figure 15.4d, suggest that there is a lasting trade-off between inflation and unemployment. For example, with the Phillips curve in the figure, if the government is happy to have inflation of 1% each year, then it can support a boom level of aggregate demand with an unemployment rate of 3% year after year.

feasible setAll of the combinations of the things under consideration that a decision-maker could choose given the economic, physical or other constraints that he faces. See also: feasible frontier.

If it prefers stable prices (zero inflation), then it needs to keep aggregate demand at the normal level, with unemployment of 6%. This suggests that the Phillips curve is a feasible set from which the policymaker can select the desired combination of unemployment and inflation. The policymaker prefers low inflation and high employment, and those preferences can be represented in the usual way in the form of indifference curves.
Work through the steps of the analysis in Figure 15.5 to see how the policymakers preferences are described by indifference curves.
Note first some important features of the diagram. Typically when drawing indifference curves, a choice further from the origin is preferred since more of what is on each axis is preferred. In this case, the policymakers best outcome is shown by point F, with inflation at the target and full employment. As we saw at the end of Section 15.1, the policymaker is likely to prefer low (stable) inflation to zero. This means the indifference curves become vertical at, say, 2% inflation. Above target inflation, the indifference curves are positively sloped, as getting employment closer to full employment is worth accepting higher (above target) inflation. Below the target, the indifference curves are negatively sloped, as getting employment closer to full employment is worth accepting lower (below target) inflation.
We assume that there are diminishing marginal returns to the two targets of high employment and low inflation. This implies that when the outcome is further from the inflation target but closer to full employment, the indifference curve is flatter because the policymaker places more value on getting closer to the inflation target. Conversely, when the outcome is further from full employment but closer to the inflation target, the indifference curve is steeper because the policymaker places more value on getting closer to full employment.

The policymakers preferences


The figure shows the policymakers indifference curves.














High employment and inflation


When employment and inflation are very high, the indifference curve is flat.














Lower employment and inflation


When inflation and employment are lower, the indifference curve is steeper.














Inflation at 2%


The indifference curve is vertical when inflation is at 2%.














Full employment


The indifference curve is horizontal when employment = labour supply.














The policymakers preferred outcome


F marks the policymakers preferred combination of inflation and unemployment.














The feasible set


The policymaker chooses from the feasible set on the Phillips curve.














The preferred feasible outcome


This is on the Phillips curve at point C.




In the right-hand panel of the figure, the indifference curves and the Phillips curve are shown. The policymaker sees the Phillips curve as the feasible set and will try to use monetary or fiscal policy to choose the level of aggregate demand so that employment is at C. This is the indifference curve closest to the best outcome of F, which is consistent with the Phillips curve trade-off.
In this example, the policymaker prefers a combination of unemployment of 3% and inflation of 5% to another feasible combination of unemployment of 6% and a stable price level (zero inflation).

Exercise 15.3 The Phillips curve and the policymakers preferences
The following questions refer to Figure 15.5.

What would the policymakers indifference curves look like if the policymaker cared only about low unemployment?
Which point on the Phillips curve would that policymaker choose?
What would the policymakers indifference curves look like if the policymaker cared only about low inflation?
Which point on the Phillips curve would this policymaker choose?
What would the indifference curves look like if, to be re-elected, the policymaker needed the support of pensioners more than that of working-age people?
