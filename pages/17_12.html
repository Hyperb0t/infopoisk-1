17.11 The role of banks in the crisis
House prices and bank solvency
The financial crisis was a banking crisisand it was global, as BNP Paribas demonstrated in August 2007 when it would not pay out to bondholders in one of its investment funds. The banks were in trouble because they had become highly leveraged and were vulnerable to a fall in the value of the financial assets that they had accumulated on their balance sheets (refer back to Figure 17.21 for the leverage of US and UK banks). The values of the financial assets were in turn based on house prices.
With a ratio of net worth to assets of 4%, as in the example of the bank in Figure 11.14, a fall in the value of its assets of an amount greater than this will render a bank insolvent. House prices fell much more than 4% in many countries in the recent financial crisis. In fact, the peak-to-trough fall in house price indices for Ireland, Spain, and the US were 50.3%, 31.6%, and 34.6% respectively. This created a problem of solvency for the banks. Just as with the underwater households, banks were in danger of their net worth being wiped out. It is relatively easy for a household to calculate whether this has happened, but not for a bank.
Unlike a house, obscure financial assets on (or often designed to be kept off) a banks balance sheet, with acronyms like CDO, CDS, CLO, and even CDO2, were hard to value. This made it difficult to judge which banks were in trouble.
Bank liquidity and the credit crunch

liquidity riskThe risk that an asset cannot be exchanged for cash rapidly enough to prevent a financial loss.

Doubts about the solvency of banks created another problem in the financial systemthe problem of liquidity risk, which we introduced in Unit 10. A characteristic feature of banking is the mismatch between short-term liabilities, which it owes to depositors, and long-term assets, which are loans owed to the bank. Consequently, banks rely on the money market, where banks borrow from and lend to each other on a short-term basis, to fund themselves when they need short-term liquidity. But the operation of the money market relies on borrowers and lenders having trust in the solvency of those with whom they trade. The expected profit on a loan is the interest rate multiplied by the probability that the borrower will not default:

Therefore, as people feared that those to whom they were lending were more likely to default, they would only lend at a high interest rate. In many cases, banks or others operating in the money markets simply refused to lend at all. Newspapers called it the credit crunch.
In Unit 10, we learned that the interest rate in the money market is tied tightly to the policy interest rate set by the central bank. This relationship broke down in the credit crunch. Borrowing on the interbank market became much more expensive and hampered the ability of central banks to stabilize the economy. Even when the central banks reduced the interest rate close to the zero lower bound, the fear that banks would default kept money market rates high. This led to high mortgage lending rates: high money-market interest rates raised a banks funding costs, as discussed in Unit 10.
Fire sales: A positive feedback process

fire saleThe sale of something at a very low price because of the sellers urgent need for money.

The forced sale of assets, known informally as a fire sale, is a positive feedback process. In the financial crisis, the fire sale is an external effect for both the housing market and the markets for financial assets, and both affected the solvency of banks.
In the housing case, it is easy to visualize. Think of a household that is underwater and cannot repay a housing loan. Its debt exceeds the market value of the house. The household is under pressure to sell quickly in order to pay off as much of the mortgage as they can, to avoid continuing interest payments. If the housing market is undergoing a crash, then they may have to accept a drastically reduced price for the house (which may still be better for them than continuing to pay interest on the whole mortgage). This is a market failure because the fire sale has an external effect, conferring a cost (a fall in price) on other owners of the same type of asset.
In the financial crisis, banks as well as households faced massive losses in the value of their financial assets and were under pressure to sell them at reduced prices in order to repay debts (for example, to depositors who wanted their deposits back). Since many banks were desperately trying to sell at the same time, these asset prices plunged. This in turn further threatened the solvency of banks and other financial institutions as part of the positive feedback loop.
Governments rescue banks
Across the advanced economies, banks failed and were rescued by governments. To find out more about how they did this, and for more background on how the financial system failed during the crisis, we suggest reading The Baseline Scenario.
In Unit 10 we highlighted the fact that banks do not bear all the costs of bankruptcy. The bank owners know that others (taxpayers or other banks) will bear some of the costs of the banks risk-taking activity. So the banks take more risks than they would take if they bore all the costs of their actions. Excess risk-taking by banks is a negative external effect leading to a market failure. And it arises because of the principalagent problem between the government (the principal) and the agent (the bank). The government is the principal because it has a direct interest in (and is held responsible for) maintaining a healthy economy, and will bear the cost of bank bailout as a consequence of excessive risk-taking by banks. Governments cannot write a complete set of rules that would align the interests of the banks with those of the government or the taxpayer.
Banks are rescued because the failure of a bank is different from the failure of a typical firm or household in a capitalist economy. Banks play a central role in the payments system of the economy and in providing loans to households and to firms. Chains of assets and liabilities link banks, and those chains had extended across the world in the years before the crisis.
The interconnectedness of banks was vividly illustrated in the credit crunch, where liquidity dried up in the money markets because each bank doubted the solvency of other banks. The event associated most closely with the financial crisis, the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, showed how interconnected banks were (and are). This was not the beginning of the crisiswe have seen that the contraction of aggregate demand in the US began with the troubles in the housing marketbut it signalled its escalation at the national and global level.
Thus the banking system, like an electricity grid, is a network. The failure of one of the elements in this connected networkwhether a household or another bankcreates pressure on every other element. Just as happens in an electricity grid, the process in a banking system may create a cascade of subsequent failures, as occurred between 2006 and 2008.
In our Economist in action video, Joseph Stiglitz, one of the few economists who warned repeatedly about the risks inherent in the financial system in the lead-up to the financial crisis, explains the combination of incentives, external effects, and positive feedback processes that led to this cascade of financial failure.

Joseph Stiglitz on why the financial crisis was a market failure.



Exercise 17.7 How conventional wisdom on financial markets contributed to the global financial crisis
In the Economist in action video of Joseph Stiglitz he explains that the financial crisis was a market failure. Watch it, and consider these questions:

What assumptions were made about financial markets before the crisis, and which assumption was particularly problematic?
How did incentives given to banks play a role in the recent financial crisis?



Exercise 17.8 Behaviour in the financial crisis






The Crisis of Credit Visualized.


The Crisis of Credit Visualized is an animated explanation of the behaviour of households and banks in the financial crisis.

Use the models discussed in this unit to explain the story told in the video.
Are there parts of the video that you cannot explain using the models and concepts from this unit?



Question 17.12 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements are correct regarding fire sales in the housing market?

A household is underwater when the value of the house it owns is less than the value of the mortgage on the house.
A fire sale occurs when a household cannot repay its mortgage and sells its house.
Fire sales have a positive externality for prospective buyers who are able to purchase the foreclosed houses cheaply.
Fire sales have a negative externality on other owners of similar assets by lowering the value of their assets.


This is the definition of an underwater household.
A fire sale is when an asset is sold in a hurry at a low price in order to avoid bankruptcy or illiquidity. In a normal housing market, a household that cannot repay its mortgage (perhaps because of job loss) might be able to sell at a normal price.
An externality is an unintended effect on parties not involved in the transaction. The possibility of buyers benefitting from cheaper prices is not an externality because they are parties to the transaction.
This is a negative externality because owners of similar assets are not parties to this particular transaction.
