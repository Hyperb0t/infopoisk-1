10.13 Inequality: Lenders, borrowers, and those excluded from credit markets
Long before there were the employers, employees, and the unemployed that we studied in the previous unit, there were lenders and borrowers. Some of the first written records of any kind were records of debts. Differences in income between those who lend (people like Marco) and those who borrow (people like Julia) remain an important source of economic inequality today.
We can analyse inequalities between borrowers and lenders (and among the borrowing class) using the same Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient model that we used to study inequality among employers and employees.
Here is an illustration. An economy is composed of 90 farmers who borrow from 10 lenders, and use the funds to finance the planting and tending of their crops. The harvest (on average) is sold for an amount greater than the farmers loan, so that for every euro borrowed and invested the farmer gains income of 1 + , where  is called the rate of profit.
Following the harvest, the farmers repay the loans with interest, at rate i. We simplify by assuming that all of the loans are repaid and that all lenders lend the same amount to the farmers at the same interest rate.
Since each euro invested produces total revenue of 1 + , each farmer produces income (revenue less costs) of . But this income is divided between the lender, who receives an income of i for every euro lent, and the borrower who receives the remainder, namely   i. So the lender receives a share of i/ of total output, and the borrower receives a share of 1  (i/).
Thus if i = 0.10 and  = 0.15 then the lenders share of total income is 2/3 and the borrowers is 1/3.
Inequality in this economy is depicted in Figure 10.21. The Gini coefficient is 0.57.
In the previous sections we showed why some would-be borrowers (those unable to post collateral or lacking their own funds to finance a project) might be excluded entirely from borrowing even if they would be willing to pay the interest rate. How does this affect the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient?
To explore this, imagine that 40 of the prospective borrowers are excluded (and since they cannot borrow, they receive no income at all) and that nothing else in the situation changes (i and  remain unchanged).
The dashed line in Figure 10.21 shows the new situation. The new Gini coefficient is 0.70, showing an increase in inequality as the result of the credit market exclusion of the poor.

Inequality in a borrowing and lending economy. Note: The Gini coefficient when there are no borrowers excluded is 0.57; when 40 are excluded, it is 0.70.
        















A model economy of lenders and borrowers


An economy is composed of 90 farmers who borrow from 10 lenders. Since i=0.10 and  = 0.15, the lenders share of total income is 2/3 and the borrowers is 1/3. The Gini coefficient is 0.57.














Some borrowers are credit market excluded


Suppose that 40 of the prospective borrowers are excluded. Since they cannot borrow, they receive no income at all.














Inequality increases


When some prospective borrowers are excluded, the Gini coefficient increases to 0.70.





Question 10.12 Choose the correct answer(s)
In an economy with a population of 100, there are 80 farmers and 20 lenders. The farmers use the funds to finance the planting and tending of their crops. The rate of profit for the harvest is 12.5%, while the interest rate charged is 10%. Compare the following two cases:

Case A: All farmers are able to borrow.
Case B: Only 50 farmers are able to borrow.

Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The share of total output received by the farmers who can borrow is 25%.
The Gini coefficient for Case A is 0.5.
The Gini coefficient for Case B is 0.6.
There is a 16.7% increase in the Gini coefficient in Case B compared to Case A.


The farmers keep 12.5  10 = 2.5% of the 12.5% profit rate. This is a 2.5/12.5 = 20% share.
The Gini coefficient for Case A is 0.6.
The Gini coefficient for Case B is 0.7.
0.7 is 16.7% higher than 0.6.


This example illustrates the fact that one cause of inequality in an economy is that some people (like Marco) are in a position to profit by lending money to others, just as others (like Bruno in Unit 5) are in a position to profit by employing others.
Bruno and Marco are probably not the best-loved characters in the economy. For similar reasons, banks are not the most popular or trusted institutions. In the US, for example, 73% of people expressed a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the military in 2016, exactly the same as the level a decade earlier. By contrast, in 2016, only 27% expressed a degree of confidence in banks, down from 49% a decade earlier. Surveys show that the public in Germany, Spain and many other countries hold their banks in low esteem. This has particularly been the case since the financial crisis of 2008.
It is sometimes said that rich people lend on terms that make them rich, while poor people borrow on terms that make them poor. Our example of Julia and Marco made it clear that ones view of the interest rateas a cost for Julia and as a source of income for Marcodepends on ones wealth. People with limited wealth are credit-constrained, which limits their ability to profit from the investment opportunities that are open to those with more assets.
It is also true that, in determining the rate of interest at which an individual will borrow, the lender often has superior bargaining power, and so can set a rate that enables him to capture most of the mutual gains from the transaction.
But do banks and the financial system make some people poor and other people rich? To answer this question, compare banks to other profit-making firms. Both are owned by wealthy people, who profit from the business they do with poorer people. Moreover, they often transact on terms (rates of interest, wages) that perpetuate the lack of wealth of borrowers and employees.

Exercise 10.8 Unpopular banks
Why do you think that banks tend to be more unpopular than other profit-making firms (Honda or Microsoft, for example)?

But even those who dislike banks do not think that the less wealthy would be better off in their absence, any more than that the less wealthy would benefit if firms ceased to employ labour. Banks, credit, and money are essential to a modern economyincluding to the economic opportunities of the less well offbecause they provide opportunities for mutual gains that occur when people can benefit by moving their buying power from one time period to another, either borrowing (moving it to the present) or lending (the opposite).

Exercise 10.9 Limits on lending
Many countries have policies that limit how much interest a moneylender can charge on a loan.

Do you think these limits are a good idea?
Who benefits from the laws and who loses?
What are likely to be the long-term effects of such laws?
Contrast this approach to helping the poor gain access to loans with the Grameen Bank in Exercise 10.7.
