16.8 Institutions and policies: Why do some countries do better than others?
What do we mean by good performance or a good outcome? The answer matters because citizens who vote for parties with alternative economic programs, and policymakers who attempt to improve those programs, will need some concept of what is desirableeither for the individual, the policymaker, or the nation.
As we saw in Unit 3, people value their free time as well as their access to goods. We should include their reward per hour of work in our evaluation of outcomes. In any given year, a good performance is one in which unemployment is low and real wages per hour are high. Putting this into a dynamic setting, and evaluating an economy over many years, we judge performance as good if a country combines rapid growth of real wages per worker hour with low unemployment.
There are of course other dimensions of long-run economic performance that most people care about. We may care whether or not the distribution of economic rewards is fair, whether or not the economys relationship with the natural environment is sustainable, or about the extent to which households are subjected to economic insecurity through business cycle fluctuations. But here we focus solely on the growth in real wages per hour and the unemployment rate.
We use the labour market model and the Beveridge curve to see that achieving good performance requires an economy to have two capacities:

To raise the price-setting curve and restrain the upward shift of the wage-setting curve: So that both hourly wage growth and the long-run employment rate are high.
To adjust rapidly and fully: So that the entire economy can take advantage of opportunities from technological change.

Technological change means jobs disappearing in firms in which new technology substitutes for workers. Jobs also disappear as new firms enter and those unable to adapt to the new conditions shut down. The Beveridge curve highlights the importance of matching workers and vacancies in the labour market. In Figure 16.9b, we saw that the impact of new technology is initially to displace workers: the Beveridge curve summarizes the economys ability to rapidly redeploy displaced workers, shortening the period the economy spends in the short-run situation (point D, Figure 16.9b).
Figure 16.12 shows long-run performance (over a 40-year period) for a group of advanced economies. It uses the criteria of real wage growth and unemployment rates. We study a long period because we do not want our evaluation of long-term performance to be affected by the particular phase of the business cycle in which a country finds itself (it will look much better at the peak than at the trough). We use wages in manufacturing because they are measured in ways that are more accurately comparable across nationsalthough this is not ideal, because the share of employment in manufacturing shrinks over time and varies across countries.
Good performance places a country in the top-left corner of Figure 16.12, with high wage growth and low unemployment; bad performance places a country in the bottom-right corner. Since we value both high wage growth and low unemployment, we may be prepared to tolerate low wage growth if it is associated with a lower level of unemployment. This means that we can represent a citizens indifference curve as a ray from the origin. Steeper rays are better, and a countrys performance is measured by the steepness of a ray from the origin to that countrys observation. If you look at Figure 16.12, and take Belgium (BEL) as an example: a Belgian citizen would prefer to be on a steeper ray, like that of Germany (GER), with lower unemployment and higher wage growth.

OECD. 2015.OECD Statistics; BLS data for Spanish real wages available only from 1979. Spanish real wage growth for 19701979 has therefore been estimated using Tables 16.25 and 16.5 from Barciela Lpez, Carlos, Albert Carreras, and Xavier Tafunell. 2005.Estadsticas histricas de Espaa: Siglos XIX-XX.

The two rays in Figure 16.12 divide the countries into three groups. The high performers over the 40-year period from 1970 to 2011 are Norway and Japan. The low performers are Belgium, Italy, US, Canada, and Spain. The poor performance of the US is in part due to the fact that it started with higher wages in 1970, because it was the worlds technology leader during this period (as we saw in Figure 16.3). This meant that other nations could learn from it, rapidly raising their productivity. Similar arguments apply to Canada. For this reason we do not take these two countries as representative of the low performers, although real wages have grown much more slowly than productivity in the US, so most US citizens did not benefit very much from economic growth in this period.
Notice that successful countries used different combinations of policies and institutions. Some of the best performers (on steeper rays from the origin) like Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Germany have powerful unions, while the Nordic countries (including Denmark) have some of the most generous unemployment benefits in the world.
Figure 16.13 reproduces the unemployment data from Figure 16.1, but with two of the high performers and two of the low performers from Figure 16.12 highlighted. The differences between Japan and Norway on one hand, and Italy and Spain on the other, centre on unemployment rather than real wage growth. In Figure 16.13 you can see how unemployment behaved differently following the oil shocks of the 1980s, and after the financial crisis.

We shall see that the model in this unit provides a useful framework for understanding the high and low performers of the labour market. We will now show how to use the model to explain the way that institutions and policies affect real wage growth and unemployment in the long run.

Exercise 16.6 You are the policymaker
Refer to Figure 16.12 to answer the following questions:

Using the same axes, draw the indifference curves of a citizen or policymaker who cares only about wage growth.
According to the data in the figure, which countries would be the high performers and which would be the low performers?
Using the same axes, draw your indifference curves if you only cared about the unemployment rate. Which countries would be the high and low performers in this case?
Using the same axes, draw an indifference curve based on your own personal preferences over wage growth and unemployment, and justify your choice.
Now considering your preferences over other economic factors, which country in the figure would you choose to live in, and why? Explain which economic factors you included in your decision.



Question 16.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
The following graph plots the real wage growth of different countries against their unemployment rate, averaged over the period 19702011.












Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

If you only cared about unemployment, then Finland is the country with the best performance.
If you only cared about wage growth, then European countries have outperformed North American countries.
If you cared about both unemployment and wage growth, then Spain is one of the best-performing countries.
If you cared about both unemployment and wage growth, then Finland has unambiguously outperformed Norway.


Japan is the country that has managed to keep its unemployment the lowest across the period.
All the European countries in the figure have had higher wage growth.
Spain has managed high wage growth, but with high unemployment.
Although Finland managed higher wage growth, it also had high unemployment. If the citizens indifference curves are given by straight lines from the origin, then in fact Norways performance would be on a higher indifference curve.
