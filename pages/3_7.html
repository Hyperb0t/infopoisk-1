3.6 Hours of work and economic growth
In 1930, John Maynard Keynes, a British economist, published an essay entitled Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, in which he suggested that in the 100 years that would follow, technological improvement would make us, on average, about eight times better off.2 What he called the economic problem, the struggle for subsistence would be solved, and we would not have to work more than, say, 15 hours per week to satisfy our economic needs. The question he raised was: how would we cope with all of the additional leisure time?
Keynes prediction for the rate of technological progress in countries such as the UK and the US has been approximately right, and working hours have indeed fallen, although much less than he expectedit seems unlikely that average working hours will be 15 hours per week by 2030. An article by Tim Harford in the Undercover Economist column of the Financial Times examines why Keynes prediction was wrong.3
As we saw in Unit 2, new technologies raise the productivity of labour. We now have the tools to analyse the effects of increased productivity on living standards, specifically on incomes and the free time of workers.
So far, we have considered Alexeis choice between studying and free time. We now apply our model of constrained choice to Angela, a self-sufficient farmer who chooses how many hours to work. We assume that Angela produces grain to eat and does not sell it to anyone else. If she produces too little grain, she will starve.
What is stopping her producing the most grain possible? Like the student, Angela also values free timeshe gets utility from both free time and consuming grain.
But her choice is constrained: producing grain takes labour time, and each hour of labour means Angela foregoes an hour of free time. The hour of free time sacrificed is the opportunity cost of the grain produced. Like Alexei, Angela faces a problem of scarcity: she has to make a choice between her consumption of grain and her consumption of free time.
To understand her choice, and how it is affected by technological change, we need to model her production function, and her preferences.
Figure 3.12 shows the initial production function before the change occurs: the relationship between the number of hours worked and the amount of grain produced. Notice that the graph has a similar concave shape to Alexeis production function: the marginal product of an additional hours work, shown by the slope, diminishes as the number of hours increases.
A technological improvement such as seeds with a higher yield, or better equipment that makes harvesting quicker, will increase the amount of grain produced in a given number of hours. The analysis in Figure 3.12 demonstrates the effect on the production function.

The initial technology


The table shows how the amount of grain produced depends on the number of hours worked per day. For example, if Angela works for 12 hours a day she will produce 64 units of grain. This is point B on the graph.














A technological improvement


An improvement in technology means that more grain is produced for a given number of working hours. The production function shifts upward, from PF to PFnew.














More grain for the same amount of work


Now if Angela works for 12 hours per day, she can produce 74 units of grain (point C).














Or same grain, less work


Alternatively, by working 8 hours a day she can produce 64 units of grain (point D), which previously took 12 hours.




Notice that the new production function is steeper than the original one for every given number of hours. The new technology has increased Angelas marginal product of labour: at every point, an additional hour of work produces more grain than under the old technology.
Leibniz: Modelling technological change
Figure 3.13 shows Angelas feasible frontier, which is just the mirror image of the production function, for the original technology (FF), and the new one (FFnew).
As before, what we call free time is all of the time that is not spent working to produce grainit includes time for eating, sleeping, and everything else that we dont count as farm work, as well as her leisure time. The feasible frontier shows how much grain can be produced and consumed for each possible amount of free time. Points B, C, and D represent the same combinations of free time and grain as in Figure 3.12. The slope of the frontier represents the MRT (the marginal rate at which free time can be transformed into grain) or equivalently the opportunity cost of free time. You can see that technological progress expands the feasible set: it gives her a wider choice of combinations of grain and free time.











An improvement in technology expands Angelas feasible set.

Now we add Angelas indifference curves to the diagram, representing her preferences for free time and grain consumption, to find which combination in the feasible set is best for her. Figure 3.14 shows that her optimal choice under the original technology is to work for 8 hours a day, giving her 16 hours of free time and 55 units of grain. This is the point of tangency, where her two trade-offs balance out: her marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between grain and free time (the slope of the indifference curve) is equal to the MRT (the slope of the feasible frontier). We can think of the combination of free time and grain at point A as a measure of her standard of living.
Follow the steps in Figure 3.14 to see how her choice changes as a result of technological progress.

Maximizing utility with the original technology


The diagram shows the feasible set with the original production function, and Angelas indifference curves for combinations of grain and free time. The highest indifference curve she can attain is IC3, at point A.














MRS = MRT for maximum utility


Her optimal choice is point A on the feasible frontier. She enjoys 16 hours of free time per day and consumes 55 units of grain. At A, her MRS is equal to the MRT.














Technological progress


An improvement in technology expands the feasible set. Now she can do better than at A.














Angelas new optimal choice


When the technology of farming has improved, Angelas optimal choice is point E, where FFnew is tangent to indifference curve IC4. She has more free time and more grain than before.




Technological change raises Angelas standard of living: it enables her to achieve higher utility. Note that in Figure 3.14 she increases both her consumption of grain and her free time.
It is important to realize that this is just one possible result. Had we drawn the indifference curves or the frontier differently, the trade-offs Angela faces would have been different. We can say that the improvement in technology definitely makes it feasible to both consume more grain and have more free time, but whether Angela will choose to have more of both depends on her preferences between these two goods, and her willingness to substitute one for the other.
To understand why, remember that technological change makes the production function steeper: it increases Angelas marginal product of labour. This means that the opportunity cost of free time is higher, giving her a greater incentive to work. But also, now that she can have more grain for each amount of free time, she may be more willing to give up some grain for more free time: that is, reduce her hours of work.
These two effects of technological progress work in opposite directions. In Figure 3.14, the second effect dominates and she chooses point E, with more free time as well as more grain. In the next section, we look more carefully at these two opposing effects, using a different example to disentangle them.

Question 3.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
The figures show Alexeis production function and his corresponding feasible frontier for final grade and hours of work or free time per day. They show the effect of an improvement in his studying technique, represented by the tilting up of the two curves.


















Consider now two cases of further changes in Alexeis study environment:
Case A. He suddenly finds himself needing to spend 4 hours a day caring for a family member. (You may assume that his marginal product of labour is unaffected for the hours that he studies.)
Case B. For health reasons his marginal product of labour for all hours is reduced by 10%.
Then:

For case A, Alexeis production function shifts to the right.
For case A, Alexeis feasible frontier shifts to the left.
For case B, Alexeis production function shifts down in a parallel manner.
For case B, Alexeis feasible frontier rotates downwards, pivoted at the intercept with the horizontal axis.


With Alexeis marginal product of labour unaffected, the production function remains the same: each number of hours worked yields the same grade as before.
The feasible frontier shifts to the left and intersects the horizontal axis at 20 hours, since 4 hours a day are now spent on care, so any given number of hours committed to free time per day now corresponds to fewer hours worked and thus a lower mark.
With the reduction in Alexeis marginal product of labour, the production function curve becomes flatter. This leads to tilting of the curve inwards, pivoted at the origin.
The reduction in the marginal product results in a lower mark for every level of hours worked (except at zero), so the feasible frontier pivots around the intercept, rotating downwards.
