8.6 Changes in supply and demand
Quinoa is a cereal crop grown on the Altiplano, a high barren plateau in the Andes of South America. It is a traditional staple food in Peru and Bolivia. In recent years, as its nutritional properties have become known, there has been a huge increase in demand from richer, health-conscious consumers in Europe and North America. Figures 8.10ac show how the market changed. You can see in Figures 8.10a and 8.10b that between 2001 and 2011, the price of quinoa trebled and production almost doubled. Figure 8.10c indicates the strength of the increase in demand: spending on imports of quinoa rose from just $2.4 million to $43.7 million in 10 years.

For the producer countries these changes are a mixed blessing. While their staple food has become expensive for poor consumers, farmerswho are amongst the poorestare benefiting from the boom in export sales. Other countries are now investigating whether quinoa can be grown in different climates, and France and the US have become substantial producers.

How can we explain the rapid increase in the price of quinoa? In this section, we look at the effects of changes in demand and supply in our simple examples of books and bread. At the end of this section you can apply the analysis to the real-world case of quinoa.

An increase in demand
In the market for second-hand textbooks, demand comes from new students enrolling on the course, and supply comes from students who took the course in the previous year. In Figure 8.11 we have plotted supply and demand for textbooks when the number of students enrolling remains stable at 40 per year. The equilibrium price is $8 and 24 books are sold, as shown by point A. Suppose that in one year the course became more popular. Figure 8.11 shows what would happen.












Figure 8.11 
An increase in the demand for books.
        















The initial equilibrium point


At the original levels of demand and supply, the equilibrium is at point A. The price is $8, and 24 books are sold.














An increase in demand


If there were more students enrolling in one year, there would be more students wanting to buy the book at each possible price. The demand curve shifts to the right.














Excess demand when the price is $8


If the price remained at $8, there would be excess demand for books, that is, more buyers than sellers.














A new equilibrium point


There is a new equilibrium at point B with a price of $10, at which 32 books are sold. The increase in demand has led to a rise in the equilibrium quantity and price.




The increase in demand leads to a new equilibrium, in which 32 books are sold for $10 each. At the original price, there would be excess demand and sellers would want to raise their prices. At the new equilibrium, both price and quantity are higher. Some students who would not have sold their books at $8 will now sell at a higher price. Notice, however, that although demand has increased, not all the students who would have bought at $8 will purchase the book at the new equilibrium: those with WTP between $8 and $10 no longer want to buy.
When we say increase in demand, its important to be careful about exactly what we mean:

Demand is higher at each possible price, so the demand curve has shifted.
In response to this shift there is a change in the price.
This leads to an increase in the quantity supplied.
This change is a movement along the supply curve.
But the supply curve itself has not shifted (the number of sellers and their reserve prices have not changed), so we do not call this an increase in supply.

After an increase in demand, the equilibrium quantity rises, but so does the price. You can see in Figure 8.11 that the steeper (more inelastic) the supply curve, the higher the price will rise and the lower the quantity will increase. If the supply curve is quite flat (elastic), then the price rise will be smaller and the quantity sold will be more responsive to the demand shock.
An increase in supply due to improved productivity
In contrast, as an example of an increase in supply, think again about the market for bread in one city. Remember that the supply curve represents the marginal cost of producing bread. Suppose that bakeries discover a new technique that allows each worker to make bread more quickly. This will lead to a fall in the marginal cost of a loaf at each level of output. In other words, the marginal cost curve of each bakery shifts down.
Figure 8.12 shows the original supply and demand curves for the bakeries. When the MC curve of each bakery shifts down, so does the market supply curve for bread. Look at Figure 8.12 to see what happens next.












An increase in the supply of bread: A fall in MC.


Figure 8.12 
An increase in the supply of bread: A fall in MC.
        















The initial equilibrium point


The citys bakeries start out at point A, producing 5,000 loaves and selling them for 2 each.














A fall in marginal costs


The market supply curve then shifts because of the fall in the bakeries marginal costs. The supply curve shifts down, because at each level of output, the marginal cost and therefore the price at which they are willing to supply bread is lower.














An increase in supply


The supply curve has shifted down. But another way to think of this change in supply is to say that the supply curve has shifted to the right. Since costs have fallen, the amount that bakeries will supply at each price is greateran increase in supply.














Excess supply when the price is 2


The effect of the fall in marginal cost is an increase in market supply. At the original price, there is more bread than buyers want (excess supply). The bakeries would want to lower their prices.














The new equilibrium point


The new market equilibrium is at point B, where more bread is sold and the price is lower. The demand curve has not shifted, but the fall in price has led to an increase in the quantity of bread demanded, along the demand curve.




The improvement in the technology of breadmaking leads to:

an increase in supply
a fall in the price of bread
a rise in the quantity sold

Leibniz: Shifts in demand and supply
As in the example of an increase in demand, an adjustment of prices is needed to bring the market into equilibrium. Such shifts in supply and demand are often referred to as shocks in economic analysis. We start by specifying an economic model and find the equilibrium. Then we look at how the equilibrium changes when something changesthe model receives a shock. The shock is called exogenous because our model doesnt explain why it happened: the model shows the consequences, not the causes.

An increase in supply: More bakeries enter the market
Another reason for a change in market supply is the entry of more firms or the exit of existing firms. We analysed the equilibrium of the bread market in the case when there were 50 bakeries in the city. Remember from Section 8.4 that at the equilibrium price of 2, each bakery is on an isoprofit curve above the average cost curve. If economic profits are greater than zero, firms are receiving an economic rent, so other firms might want to invest in the baking business.

costs of entryStartup costs that would be incurred when a seller enters a market or an industry. These would usually include the cost of acquiring and equipping new premises, research and development, the necessary patents, and the cost of finding and hiring staff.

Since there is an opportunity for making greater than normal profit by selling bread in the city, new bakeries may decide to enter the market. There will be some costs of entry, for example, acquiring and equipping the premises, but provided these are not too high (or if premises and equipment can be easily sold if the venture doesnt work out) it will be worthwhile to do so.
Remember that we find the market supply curve by adding up the amounts of bread supplied by each firm, at each price. When more bakeries have entered, more bread will be supplied at each price level. Although the reason for the supply increase is different from the previous one, the effect on the market equilibrium is the same: a fall in price and a rise in bread sales. Figure 8.13 shows the effects on equilibrium. The bakeries once again start off at point A, selling 5,000 loaves of bread for 2. The entry of new firms shifts the supply curve outwards. There is more bread for sale at each price, so at the original price there would be excess supply. The new equilibrium is at point B with a lower price and higher bread sales.











An increase in the supply of bread: More firms enter.


Figure 8.13 
An increase in the supply of bread: More firms enter.
        




The entry of new firms is unlikely to be welcomed by the existing bakeries. Their costs have not changed, but the market price has fallen to 1.75, so they must be making less profit than before. As we will see in Unit 11, the entry of new firms may eventually drive economic profits to zero, eliminating rents altogether.

Exercise 8.5 The market for quinoa
Consider again the market for quinoa. The changes shown in Figures 8.10ac can be analysed as shifts in demand and supply.

Suppose there was an unexpected increase in demand for quinoa in the early 2000s (a shift in the demand curve). What would you expect to happen to the price and quantity initially?
Assuming that demand continued to rise over the next few years, how do you think farmers responded?
Why did the price stay constant until 2007?
How could you account for the rapid price rise in 2008 and 2009?
Would you expect the price to fall eventually to its original level?





Exercise 8.6 Prices, shocks, and revolutions
Historians usually attribute the wave of revolutions in Europe in 1848 to long-term socioeconomic factors and a surge of radical ideas. But a poor wheat harvest in 1845 lead to food shortages and sharp price rises, which may have contributed to these sudden changes.6
The table shows the average and peak prices of wheat from 1838 to 1845, relative to silver. There are three groups of countries: those where violent revolutions took place, those where constitutional change took place without widespread violence, and those where no revolution occurred.

Explain, using supply and demand curves, how a poor wheat harvest could lead to price rises and food shortages.
Find a way to present the data to show that the size of the price shock, rather than the price level, is associated with the likelihood of revolution.
Do you think this is a plausible explanation for the revolutions that occurred?
A journalist suggests that similar factors played a part in the Arab Spring in 2010. Read the post. What do you think of this hypothesis?

Question 8.7 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 8.8 shows the equilibrium of the bread market to be 5,000 loaves per day at price 2. A year later, we find that the market equilibrium price has fallen to 1.50. What can we conclude?

The fall in the price must have been caused by a downward shift in the demand curve.
The fall in the price must have been caused by a downward shift in the supply curve.
The fall in price could have been caused by a shift in either curve.
At a price of 1.50, there will be an excess demand for bread.


This is not the only possible cause of a fall in price.
This is not the only possible cause of a fall in price.
A downward shift in either curve would cause the price to fall. If we knew whether output had increased or decreased, we could determine which curve had shifted.
At the market equilibrium price, there is no excess demand or supply.



Question 8.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements are correct?

A fall in the mortgage interest rate would shift up the demand curve for new houses.
The launch of a new Sony smartphone would shift up the demand curve for existing iPhones.
A fall in the oil price would shift up the demand curve for oil.
A fall in the oil price would shift down the supply curve for plastics.


If mortgage borrowing becomes cheaper, more people will want to buy houses at each house price.
A launch of a substitute would decrease demand, shifting the demand curve down.
The quantity of oil demanded would increase by moving along the demand curve; the curve itself would not move.
The marginal cost of producing plastics would fall, so the supply curve would shift down.
