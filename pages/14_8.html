14.7 The multiplier and economic policymaking
In the multiplier model, we have used simple ways of modelling aggregate consumption, investment, trade, and government fiscal policy. This means there are a small number of variables from which the size of the multiplier is calculated (the marginal propensity to consume, the marginal propensity to import, and the tax rate). When we apply the model to the real world, it is important to realize that there is no single multiplier that applies at all times.

Crowding out
The effect of an increase in government spending in reducing private spending, as would be expected for example in an economy working at full capacity utilization, or when a fiscal expansion is associated with a rise in the interest rate.


crowding outThere are two quite distinct uses of the term. One is the observed negative effect when economic incentives displace peoples ethical or other-regarding motivations. In studies of individual behaviour, incentives may have a crowding out effect on social preferences. A second use of the term is to refer to the effect of an increase in government spending in reducing private spending, as would be expected for example in an economy working at full capacity utilization, or when a fiscal expansion is associated with a rise in the interest rate.

The multiplier will be a different size if the economy is operating at full capacity utilization and low unemployment than in a recession. With fully employed resources, a 1% increase in government spending would displace or crowd out some private spending in the economy. To consider an extreme case, if all workers are employed, then an increase in government employment can only come about by taking workers out of the private sector. If increased government production were offset exactly by reduced private sector production, then the multiplier would be zero.
We would not normally expect a government to undertake a fiscal expansion when unemployment is very lowalthough it may in exceptional circumstances like war, as the US did in the later years of the Second World War and in the Vietnam War.
The size of the multiplier will also depend on the expectations of firms and businesses. The economy is not like a bicycle tyre, from which air can be pumped in or let out to keep the pressure at the right level. Households and firms react to policy changes, but they also anticipate them. For example, if firms anticipate that the government will stabilize the economy following a negative shock, this will support business confidence, and the policymaker will be able to use a smaller stimulus. Alternatively, if households think that higher government spending will be followed by higher taxes, those who have the ability to save may put aside more of their money to pay the extra taxes. If this happened, it would reduce the impact of the stimulus.
When the financial crisis in 2008 led to the biggest fall in GDP in many economies since the Great Depression, the worlds policymakers expected an answer from economists: would fiscal policy help to stabilize the economy? The multiplier model, inspired by Keynes analysis of the Great Depression, suggested that it would. But by 2008, many economists doubted that the Keynesian model was still relevant. The crisis has revived interest in it and has led to a greater, though not complete, consensus among economists about the size of the multiplier (see below).
In 2012 a study published by Alan Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, two economists, showed how the multiplier varies in size according to whether the economy is in a recession or in an expansion.5 This is exactly the insight that policymakers needed in 2008.
For the US, their study suggested a $1 increase in government spending in the US raises output by about $1.50 to $2.00 in a recession, but only about $0.50 in an expansion. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko extended their research to other countries and found similar results. They also found that the effect of autonomous increases in spending in one country had spillover effects on the countries with which they trade. These effects were about the same magnitude as the indirect effects of second, third, and further rounds of spending in the home country.

How economists learn from facts The Mafia and the multiplier

natural experimentAn empirical study exploiting naturally occurring statistical controls in which researchers do not have the ability to assign participants to treatment and control groups, as is the case in conventional experiments. Instead, differences in law, policy, weather, or other events can offer the opportunity to analyse populations as if they had been part of an experiment. The validity of such studies depends on the premise that the assignment of subjects to the naturally occurring treatment and control groups can be plausibly argued to be random.reverse causalityA two-way causal relationship in which A affects B and B also affects A.

It may surprise you that economists have used the Italian governments struggle against the Mafia to uncover the size of the multiplier, but thats what Antonio Acconcia, Giancarlo Corsetti, and Saverio Simonelli were able to do.6 Adopting the natural experiment method to address the problem of reverse causality, they used data on Mafia-related dismissals of local politicians to isolate the variation in public spending that is not caused by variations in output.
After legal changes in 1991, the central government dismissed provincial councils in Italy who were revealed to have close links with the Mafia, and appointed new officials in their place. These technocrats cut local spending by 20% on average. The change in public spending occurred because of the Mafia links, through their effect on the replacement of government officials. And because there is no direct causal link from proximity to the Mafia to the variation in output, proximity to the Mafia can be used to uncover the causal effect of a change in public spending on output. This situation is illustrated in Figure 14.13.

Using this method, the researchers were able to estimate multipliers of 1.5 at the local level.
Economists have used their ingenuity to come up with methods of estimating the size of the multiplier and the implication of its operation for jobs. Using the US stimulus program that was implemented in the wake of the financial crisis (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion fiscal stimulus), we would expect that US states that were more severely hit by the financial crisis would have had higher unemployment and attracted more stimulus spending by the government. So unemployment causes more spending in those states. This makes it difficult to estimate the effect of higher spending on output and unemployment, which is what we want to do if we want to know the size of the multiplier.
One approach to get around this problem of reverse causality is to make use of the fact that some of the spending in the US stimulus program was distributed to US states using a formula that was unrelated to the severity of the recession experienced in each state. For example, some road-repair expenditures funded by the stimulus package were based on the length of highway in each state.7
Given the formula for allocating road-building funds and the fact that more miles of highway has no direct effect on the change in unemployment, this allows us to answer the question: were more jobs created in states that received more stimulus spending?8

Using US stimulus highway spending to estimate the multiplier.
        




The results of studies using this approach estimated a multiplier of 2, and suggest that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created between 1 million and 3 million new jobs.
In spite of scepticism among some economists before the 2008 crisis that the multiplier was greater than one, policymakers around the world embarked on fiscal stimulus programs in 200809. Fiscal stimulus was credited with helping to avert another Great Depression, as we will see in Unit 17.


When economists disagree How responsive is the economy to government spending?
There are few questions in economic policy discussed as heatedly in the years since the financial crisis in 2008 as the size of the fiscal multiplier: what is the effect on GDP of a 1% increase in government spending?
Much of the heat is generated by political differences among those involved. People who favour greater government expenditure tend to think the multiplier is large, while those who would like a smaller government tend to think that it is small. (We dont know whether this correlation is because their beliefs about government influence their estimates of the size of the multiplier, or the other way round.)
This debate has been going on since the first theoretical formalization of the multiplier by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s. The recent economic crisis has revitalized it for two reasons:

Monetary policy could not be used: Following the financial crisis, several major economies remained in recession despite central banks cutting interest rates to very close to zero. As we will see in the next unit, interest rates cannot be cut below zero, so governments wanted to know if the fiscal stimulus of an increase in government spending would help stabilize the economy.
Arguments about whether austerity works: After the Eurozone crisis in 2010, many European countries that were in recession adopted austerity measures of cutting government spending, with the objective of bringing their public finances back to balance.

In both stimulus and austerity, the success of the policy depends on the size of the multiplier. If the multiplier is negativewhich could happen if a rising fiscal deficit causes a large reduction in confidencea stimulus package would lead to a reduction in GDP, and an austerity policy would cause GDP to rise. If the multiplier is positive but less than 1, a fiscal stimulus would raise GDP but by less than the increase in government spending. If, as in our multiplier model, the multiplier is greater than 1, a fiscal stimulus would raise GDP by more than the increase in government spending and a policy of austerity would reinforce the recession conditions.
Depending on methodologies and assumptions, economists have put forward different estimates of multipliers, from negative numbers to values greater than 2. For instance, members of President Obamas Council of Economic Advisors estimated the multiplier as 1.6 when they prepared the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The International Monetary Fund presented estimates in 2012 that multipliers in advanced economies were, after the crisis, between 0.9 and 1.7.9
To be effective, government spending needs to put resources that would otherwise be idle into productive use. These resources can be unemployed (or underemployed) workers, as well as offices, shops, or factories functioning with spare capacity. When an economy functions at full capacity (with no idle resources), extra government spending will crowd out private spending.
Robert Barro and Paul Krugman, the economists, disagreed about the size of the multiplier in the weeks that followed the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009. Using data on government defence spending during the Second World War, Barro concluded that the multiplier was not larger than 0.8. That is, spending $1 on military equipment yielded only 80 cents of output. However, Krugman responded that in wartime there are no idle productive resources to take advantage of. People of working age were in work supporting the war effort in factories, and the government used rationing to depress private consumption.10
In the recessions that followed the Eurozone crisis in 2010, just as new economic research was finding evidence that multipliers in recessions were well above one, many European governments implemented fiscal austerity to balance their budgets. These countries had poor growth outcomesanother sign that, in deep recessions, the multiplier is greater than one. But some Eurozone countries had no choice but to adopt austerity policies. As we will see in the next section, they had lost the ability to borrow.


Exercise 14.5 Methods to estimate the multiplier
Consider the three methods discussed in this unit that have been used to estimate the size of the multiplier: the Mafia-related dismissals in Italy, the stimulus highway spending in the US, and wartime defence spending in the US.
Why do you think estimates of the size of the multiplier vary? Use the material in this unit to support your explanation.


Exercise 14.6 Contributions to change in real gross domestic product over the business cycle
In the table in Figure 13.8 we showed the contributions of the main components of expenditure (C, I, G, and X  M) made to US GDP growth during the recession of 2009. We can use FRED to see whether these contributions changed during the recovery phase of the recession.
Go to the FRED website. You can watch this short tutorial to understand how FRED works. Search for Contribution to GDP using the search bar, and select this annual series:

Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product: Personal consumption expenditures

Make sure the frequency is quarterly. To change the frequency of your series, click the Edit graph button above the top-right corner of the graph.
This button also allows you to add other series to your graph. Click on Add line and search for the following series:

Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product: Gross private domestic investment
Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product: Government consumption expenditures and gross investment
Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product: Net exports of goods and services

Finally, add a series for real GDP (Real Gross Domestic Product). Make sure you select quarterly frequency for all series on your graph.

Do the contributions to GDP add up approximately to the growth of GDP?

Now use the data you have downloaded to carry out the following tasks for the period from 2007 to 2014:

Describe the contributions to US GDP growth in the recession (2008 Q1 to 2009 Q2) and in the recovery phase from 2009 Q3 of the business cycle. If you analyse the data using the FRED graph, you will see the recession shaded in the chart. Prepare a table like the one in Figure 13.8.
What might explain the differences seen in the role of consumption and investment during the recession and recovery phases of the business cycle?
From the contribution to GDP growth of government consumption and investment expenditure, what can you infer about the US governments fiscal policy during the crisis?

Note: To make sure you understand how these FRED graphs are created, you may want to extract the data into your spreadsheet and reproduce the series.


Exercise 14.7 The fall of France
In an article from August 2014, The Fall of France, Paul Krugman criticizes the austerity policy implemented in France.
Use what you have learned about the fiscal multiplier to explain why, in Krugmans opinion, fiscal austerity in France (and more generally in Europe) would fail (explain carefully what you think Krugman means by fail).


Exercise 14.8 Stimulus without more debt
Read Stimulus, Without More Debt by Robert Shiller.
Assume the economy is in a recession. The government has a high level of debt and wants to set a balanced budget, that is, G = T. How can the government achieve a fiscal stimulus effect on GDP whilst keeping the budget balanced?
To answer the question, take the following steps:

Show how this is possible in a multiplier diagram, ensuring that you label the relevant intercepts and angles. Make the diagram sufficiently accurate so that the exact size of the multiplier is visible.
Explain in words how the government can achieve such a fiscal stimulus effect whilst keeping the budget balanced.
Derive the balanced budget multiplier using algebra. (Hint: You will need to write down expressions for the change in GDP associated with a change in both G and T and set these equal to each other.)
Comment briefly on any disadvantages you see with the use of this balanced budget fiscal stimulus.

You can make the following assumptions:

Assume a lump sum tax. This means that the tax does not depend on the level of income, T = T, rather than our usual assumption that T = tY.
Also assume that the country does not have any imports or exports.



Question 14.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding the multiplier?

Economists tend to agree on their estimates of the multiplier.
Reverse causation can be a problem when estimating the multiplier empirically.
If households anticipate that increased government spending will be funded by future tax increases, then the multiplier will be higher.
If firms anticipate that the governments fiscal policy will be effective, then the multiplier will be higher.


Estimates of the multiplier vary widely.
If more fiscal stimulus is given to economies with higher unemployment then reverse causality can be a problem for estimates of the multiplier.
In this case, households may increase savings today in order to pay for the anticipated tax increases, reducing their marginal propensity to spend and hence reducing the multiplier.
Firms will increase investment if they believe the economy will recover quickly, increasing demand.
