3.3 Opportunity costs

opportunity costWhen taking an action implies forgoing the next best alternative action, this is the net benefit of the foregone alternative.

Alexei faces a dilemma: we know from looking at his preferences that he wants both his grade and his free time to be as high as possible. But given his production function, he cannot increase his free time without getting a lower grade in the exam. Another way of expressing this is to say that free time has an opportunity cost: to get more free time, Alexei has to forgo the opportunity of getting a higher grade.
In economics, opportunity costs are relevant whenever we study individuals choosing between alternative and mutually exclusive courses of action. When we consider the cost of taking action A we include the fact that if we do A, we cannot do B. So not doing B becomes part of the cost of doing A. This is called an opportunity cost because doing A means forgoing the opportunity to do B.
Imagine that an accountant and an economist have been asked to report the cost of going to a concert, A, in a theatre, which has a $25 admission cost. In a nearby park there is concert B, which is free but happens at the same time.

Accountant
The cost of concert A is your out-of-pocket cost: you paid $25 for a ticket, so the cost is $25.
Economist
But what do you have to give up to go to concert A? You give up $25, plus the enjoyment of the free concert in the park. So the cost of concert A for you is the out-of-pocket cost plus the opportunity cost.

Suppose that the most you would have been willing to pay to attend the free concert in the park (if it wasnt free) was $15. The benefit of your next best alternative to concert A would be $15 of enjoyment in the park. This is the opportunity cost of going to concert A.

economic costThe out-of-pocket cost of an action, plus the opportunity cost.

So the total economic cost of concert A is $25 + $15 = $40. If the pleasure you anticipate from being at concert A is greater than the economic cost, say $50, then you will forego concert B and buy a ticket to the theatre. On the other hand, if you anticipate $35 worth of pleasure from concert A, then the economic cost of $40 means you will not choose to go to the theatre. In simple terms, given that you have to pay $25 for the ticket, you will instead opt for concert B, pocketing the $25 to spend on other things and enjoying $15 worth of benefit from the free park concert.
Why dont accountants think this way? Because it is not their job. Accountants are paid to keep track of money, not to provide decision rules on how to choose among alternatives, some of which do not have a stated price. But making sensible decisions and predicting how sensible people will make decisions involve more than keeping track of money. An accountant might argue that the park concert is irrelevant:

Accountant
Whether or not there is a free park concert does not affect the cost of going to the concert A. The cost to you is always $25.
Economist
But whether or not there is a free park concert can affect whether you go to concert A or not, because it changes your available options. If your enjoyment from A is $35 and your next best alternative is staying at home, with enjoyment of $0, you will choose concert A. However, if concert B is available, you will choose it overA.


economic rentA payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or reservation option). See also: reservation option.

In Unit 2, we said that if an action brings greater net benefits than the next best alternative, it yields an economic rent and you will do it. Another way of saying this is that you receive an economic rent from taking an action when it results in a benefit greater than its economic cost (the sum of out-of-pocket and opportunity costs).
The table in Figure 3.8 summarizes the example of your choice of which concert to attend.

Question 3.6 Choose the correct answer(s)
You are a taxi driver in Melbourne who earns A$50 for a days work. You have been offered a one-day ticket to the Australian Open for A$40. As a tennis fan, you value the experience at A$100. With this information, what can we say?

The opportunity cost of the day at the Open is A$40.
The economic cost of the day at the Open is A$40.
The economic rent of the day at the Open is A$10.
You would have paid up to A$100 for the ticket.


By going to the Open you are foregoing the opportunity of earning A$50 from taxi driving. This is your opportunity cost.
The economic cost is the sum of the actual price you pay plus the opportunity cost, which in this case is A$40 + A$50 = A$90.
The economic rent of an action is its benefit minus its economic cost (out-of-pocket plus opportunity costs). Therefore, the economic rent is A$100  A$40  A$50 = A$10.
The maximum price you would have paid for the ticket is the price at which your economic rent would be zero, which in this case is A$50.



Exercise 3.5 Opportunity costs
The British government introduced legislation in 2012 that gave universities the option to raise their tuition fees. Most chose to increase annual tuition fees for students from 3,000 to 9,000.
Does this mean that the cost of going to university has tripled? (Think about how an accountant and an economist might answer this question. To simplify, assume that the tuition fee is an out of pocket cost. Ignore student loans.)
