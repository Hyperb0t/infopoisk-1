19.8 Predistribution

redistribution policyTaxes, monetary, and in-kind transfers of the government that result in a distribution of final income that differs from the distribution of market income. See also: predistribution policy.predistribution policyGovernment actions that affect the endowments people have and their value, including the distribution of market income and the distribution of privately held wealth. Examples include education, minimum wage, and anti-discrimination policies. See also: redistribution policy.


statutory minimum wageA minimum level of pay laid down by law, for workers in general or of some specified type. The intention of a minimum wage is to guarantee living standards for the low-paid. Many countries, including the UK and the US, enforce this with legislation. Also known as: minimum wage.

Governments influence the degree of inequality in the economy. They do this in two ways:

Redistribution: By taxes and transfers that result in a distribution of disposable income that differs from the distribution of market income (as we saw in Figure 19.1) and by expenditure that provides public services to households.
Predistribution: By affecting the endowments that people have and the value of those endowments, leading to a change in the inequality in market income (going back to Figure 19.1 again, here governments affect the distribution of earnings before taxes and transfers or the distribution of privately held wealth).

Examples of predistribution that you have already seen include:

Increased education of the workforce: This changes the endowments of employees, adding skills and other work relevant capacities that will affect market incomes.
Eliminating or reducing labour market segmentation: Thisand other anti-discrimination policieswill alter the prices (wages) that a persons endowment will be paid in the labour market. In particular, it raises the value of the endowments of people who otherwise would suffer discrimination.

Other aspects of predistribution affect the basic institutional structure of the economy. By defining and enforcing the legal framework in which the employers, banks, employees, unions, borrowers, and other key economic actors interact, governments affect the distribution of market income. Using the legal system, governments can also alter which property rights are protected, for example banning slavery, legalizing unions (Units 9 and 16), establishing trading rights in emissions (Unit 18), or setting the duration of intellectual property rights and patents (Unit 21). All of these measures can change the relative bargaining power between groups as well as their reservation options, which in turn will change the distribution of income.

Arin Dube describes his study that found that, on average, raising the minimum wage increased the income of poor workers.


Finally, governments can change the set of contracts that are allowed, which alters the distribution of income. We discussed one example in Unit5, when we saw the effect of legislation that limited the maximum hours that employees could work.
Another important example of predistribution by limiting the kinds of contracts that are allowed is a statutory minimum wage, which prohibits contracts with wages below a certain level. This affects the value of a workers endowment of labour, but it may also affect the likelihood that the worker will be able to find a job. The costs of the minimum wage could be fewer jobs.
Arin Dube, an economist, studied differential changes in minimum wages in bordering local areas in the US.11 In our Economist in action video he explains that he found that raising the minimum wage had a little negative impact on employment but increased the income of poor workers on average.

James Heckman describes why investing in the early years of disadvantaged childrens lives is both fair and efficient.


Ensuring high-quality early childhood education is another predistribution policy.12 In our Economist in action video, James Heckman, a Nobel-prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, shows how economists can learn from experiments and other data about how to level the playing field for children growing up poor.
Figure 19.23 lists a set of policies that can reduce inequality in market incomes, drawn from this and other units.






Endowment
Policy
Direct effect
Indirect effect
Unit




Labour
Free high-quality primary education for all children
Increases opportunities for poorer children to attain more advanced levels of schooling, which increases the market value of their endowment of labour
Raises average productivity of labour, shifting up price-setting curve, which increases wages and employment (ceteris paribus)
U19


Labour
Raise the share of the harvest going to the farmer
Increases the value of the farmers endowment of labour
Raises farmers incomes
U5


Labour
Eliminate ethnic, racial, or gender discrimination
Increases the value of the labour endowment of those targeted by discrimination
Raises incomes of targeted groups
U19


Labour
Minimum wage
Increases value of labour endowments among those who were previously unable to work for more than the minimum wage
Raises incomes of the poor and reduces incomes of employers (unless employment effects dominate)
U19


Labour
Laws and policies to increase workers bargaining power (for example trade unions)
Increases value of labour endowments of trade union members and improves working conditions
Raises incomes of trade union members (unless negative employment or productivity effects dominate) and reduces incomes of employers
U9, U16, U19


Ownership of firms
Policies to ensure competition
Reduces price markup
Raises real wages, reduces profits
U7, U9, U16


Intellectual property
Restrict IPRs (for example shorter patents or copyrights)
Reduces value of endowment of intellectual property among IPR holders.
May discourage innovation but enables quicker diffusion of innovations
U21


Professional license
Allow easier access to licenses (for example for taxis)
Increases supply and reduces incomes of license holders.
Greater equality (if license holders are richer than average)
U19

Predistribution policies that can reduce inequality in market incomes.
        





non-compete contractA contract of employment containing a provision or agreement by which the worker cannot leave to work for a competitor. This may reduce the reservation option of the worker, lowering the wage that the employer needs to pay.


Exercise 19.9 Non-compete contracts in the labour market model
Legislation can rule out particular kinds of contracts, such as those that prohibit employees from leaving their firm to work for a competitor. The justification offered for these non-compete contractsis that workers leaving a firm may take with them industrial or trade secrets that would benefit the competition. But in the US, non-compete clauses are even included in contracts of fast-food workers. Use the labour market model to explain why employers would introduce non-compete contracts in sectors where industrial secrets are not an issue.


Question 19.8 Choose the correct answer(s)
According to our Economist in action video of Arin Dube, which of the following was a finding of his study of the minimum wage increase?

Increasing the minimum wage increased worker turnover.
A 10% increase in minimum wage resulted in a 4% increase in earnings.
A 10% increase in minimum wage resulted in a 4% decrease in employment.
There was a minimal negative effect on employment.


This could be true, but is not stated in the video.

This is definitely stated in the video.



Question 19.9 Choose the correct answer(s)
Watch our Economist in action video of James Heckman. According to Heckman, which of the following individual attributes are NOT among the reasons for persistent poverty in a family from generation to generation?

inherited IQ
limited schooling
race
social behaviour


Inherited IQ could contribute to persistent poverty, but it is not mentioned in the video.
Heckman argues that this is among the reasons for persistent poverty.
