20.10 Policy choices matter
Differences between countries
Environmental policies make a difference. We can see that countries vary greatly in the global environmental damage they inflict and in their success at managing environmental quality in their country. Figure 20.25a shows CO2 emissions per capita for each country in 2010 alongside income per capita. Richer countries produce more CO2 per capita than poorer ones. This is to be expected because greater income per capita is the result of a higher level of production of goods and services per capita, with associated impacts on the biosphere. This is shown by the upward-sloped line that indicates the relationship between the two variables.

But notice, too, that among countries at approximately the same level of per capita income, some emit much more than others. Compare the high emissions levels in the US, Canada, and Australia with the lower emissions levels of France, Sweden, and Germany, countries at approximately the same level of per capita income. Another way to read the graph is horizontally: Norway has the same emissions level that would be predicted (by the line) for a country $20,000 poorer in per capita income. Russia pollutes as much as would be expected from a country $20,000 richer.
Measured by its direct emissions, Singapore is a high-performing outlier. It is a high-income city-state with an effective public transport network and a commercial rather than industrial economic base, resulting in limited levels of pollution. In addition to public transportation, the government has adopted other effective environmental policies. For example, if you want to use a car in Singapore, you are first required to purchase a permit for a car at an auction, and then pay the congestion charge (a tax) every time you drive into the city.

 but so is the quality of their local environment.

Though richer countries emit more CO2 per capita, they have also adopted more effective policies to manage their own environmental resources, such as forests, soil, biodiversity, and water. Figure 20.25b plots the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) against GDP per capita. The EPI is a broad index of country-level environmental health and ecosystem vitality, including the state of wastewater treatment, fisheries, and forests. It brings together 20 different country-level indicators including trends in carbon emissions, fish stocks, changes in forest cover, quality of wastewater treatment, access to sanitation, air pollution, and child mortality. In this case, a curved rather than straight line fits the data better, indicating that differences in per capita income are associated with major differences in the EPI for very poor countries, but not as major for the richer countries, on average.
As in Figure 20.25a, Russia underperforms, with the Environmental Performance Index expected of a country half as rich. Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland are high performers. Notice that Australia, which is an unusually big emitter of CO2 (Figure 20.25a), is a top performer on the national environmental amenities measured by the EPI. A good part of the environmental damage done by economic activity in Australia is thus imposed as a cost on those outside the country.
The message of Figure 20.25b is similar to the previous one. Countries, even at similar levels of income per capita, differ greatly in their environmental performance. Compare Switzerland with the US or Spain with Russia, for example. Both India and China are substantially below the line. These country differences suggest the importance of the kinds of policies that are adopted and enforced.
Lessons from the existence of win-win policies
We have introduced many difficult trade-offs confronting environmental policies, for example, between our consumption now and our environmental quality now. But we have also uncovered some evidence of win-win opportunities.
In Figure 20.26, we look again at the estimates of the marginal abatement costs that we previously saw in Figure 20.9. The global abatement cost curve is displayed vertically in Figure 20.26. In Figure 20.9, we only included measures that are costly and would have to be promoted as an objective of government policy. In Figure 20.26, when the monetary benefit is greater than the cost, the bar extends to the left of the vertical axis. When cost is greater, it extends to the right.
All of the actions to the left of the vertical axis in Figure 20.26 would not only accomplish significant abatement, but would also be privately beneficial in the sense that they result in monetary benefits greater than the costs. These are win-win actions because they improve the environment, and their cost savings also allow greater consumption.
Replacing incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs in our houses is one of these win-win opportunities. It is the most cost-saving policy of all but it is a narrow bar, meaning it does not have a big abatement potential. Fuel-efficient vehicles, insulation in houses and offices, and other technologies with bars to the left of the axis are also cost-saving. Note that if we were only to adopt cost-saving policies between now and 2030, we would still achieve more than a quarter of the total potential abatement shown in the figure.

We can represent the unrealized abatement potential of these changes in the feasible set figure. The dashed line in Figure 20.27 is the feasible frontier that we have been using thus far, which ignored the win-win opportunities shown on the left side of Figure 20.26. The solid feasible frontier takes account of the possible use of these win-win options.
Start at point C on the horizontal axis in Figure 20.27. The evidence from Figure 20.26 is that implementing the measures (starting at the top of Figure 20.26, with replacement of incandescent bulbs by LEDs) will generate abatement benefits and at the same time allow for higher consumption of other goods and services.
This produces the positively sloped part of the feasible frontier, with both environmental quality and consumption rising from C to D. Once all the win-win measures have been introduced, at D, it begins to be costly to achieve further abatement and the feasible frontier is negatively sloped, as we saw when we analysed the implications of Figure 20.9.
The unrealized abatement potential of changes, that would save money for the individuals or firms implementing them, suggests that implementation by market incentives may be slow and incomplete. The fact that environmental benefits could be generated by economic decisions that would provide monetary benefits (not costs) to the decision-maker means mutual gains are feasible but are not being realized. Thus, Figure 20.27 provides another piece of evidence that contemporary economies are often not even close to being Pareto efficient.
These factors point to a primary advantage of policies to make some environmentally harmful practices illegal rather than simply making them more expensive. In those cases where the government has the necessary information and enforcement capacities, implementation can be rapid and complete. An example is the dramatic reduction in the use of lead in petrol in many countries around the world, following a ban. But as we will see in Unit 22, governments often lack the information and administrative capabilities to design and implement effective policies of this kind.

Is there always a trade-off between consumption and environmental quality?
        















Unrealized potential


We use the feasible set figure to represent the unrealized abatement potential.














Win-win actions


Moving from C to D takes the quality of the environment up to E. Consumption rises because costs (for example for lighting) fall.














Implementing abatement along the feasible frontier


Moving from D to Z takes the quality of the environment above E, but at the cost of lower consumption.




Is make the polluter pay fair?

polluter pays principleA guide to environmental policy according to which those who impose negative environmental effects on others should be made to pay for the damages they impose, through taxation or other means.

Think about the polluter pays principle. This principle can be interpreted as an application of the basic economics of environmental policies. Environmental external effects often impose costs on others, and making the polluter pay for these external effects is a way to internalize (and therefore eliminate) them.
This could be accomplished by taxing the polluting activity so as to equate the marginal private cost with the marginal social cost. This may be an efficient way to abate the pollution. But as we saw in Unit 12, the same abatement could be accomplished by providing the firm with a subsidy for the use of an alternative technology that resulted in a lower level of pollution.
The firms view of these two policies may be that the tax is the stick and the subsidy the carrot. The tax, which reflects the polluter pays principle, lowers the profits of the firm. A subsidy raises the firms profits. Whether the carrot or the stick is the right policy depends on the feasibility and cost of implementing the subsidy compared to the tax, and whether raising or lowering the income of the target of the policy is desired on fairness grounds.
Seen in this light, the polluter pays principle is not always a good guide to the best policy. Think of a large city in a low-income country in which much of the cooking is still done over wood fires, generating high levels of airborne particulate matter and causing asthma and other respiratory illnesses:

Fairness: It is mostly poor families who lack the income or access to electricity that would allow them to cook and heat their homes with fewer external environmental effects. In this case, many would object to making the polluters pay on the grounds of fairness, and instead favour subsidizing kerosene or providing a better electricity supply.
Effectiveness: Subsidizing kerosene is likely to be cost-effective in reducing smog, compared to tracking down and extracting payments from hundreds of thousands of people who are polluting the citys air with wood fires.

This example is helpful because it shows not only the value of considering fairness as well as efficiency, but also the importance of being clear about which objective we are pursuing when we design policies.

Exercise 20.14 High and low performers

Find out about the environmental policies and political systems of one or more of these countries using the World Bank Development Indicators, the Freedom in The World data, and your own research. What information from these sources helps you to explain the differences between high and low performers, and how does it help?



Question 20.11 Choose the correct answer(s)
Figure 20.27 is the diagram of the amount abated for the total cost of abatement using different abatement policies.
Based on this information, which of the following statements is correct?

The points between C and D represent the more costly policies being adopted first.
D should always be the optimal policy choice.
The optimal policy choice can be a point on the segment CD.
The optimal policy choice will have the quality of the environment higher than E.


False. The upward slope indicates that the policies being adopted both increase abatement and consumption.
False. The optimal policy choice depends on both the feasible frontier and citizens preferences. D maximizes consumption and will therefore only be the optimal choice if the policymaker puts no value on abatement.
False. Assuming that the policymaker values both consumption and abatement, point D will always provide a better outcome than any point on segment CD.
True. This point corresponds to maximizing consumption and will therefore only be the optimal choice if the policymaker puts no value on abatement. In other words, any indifference curves that are not vertical lines will be tangent to the feasible frontier at a higher level of abatement.
