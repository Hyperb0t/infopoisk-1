Unit 18 The nation and the world economy
How the integration of national economies into a global system of trade and investment provides opportunities for mutual gains and conflicts over the distribution of the gains

Globalization is a term referring to the integration of the worlds markets in goods and services, as well as flows of investment and people across national boundaries.
Globalization has led to the prices of goods converging across countries, but much less so of wages.
Nations tend to specialize in the production of the goods and services in which they are relatively low-cost producers, for example because of economies of scale, an abundance of the relevant resources or skills, or public policies.
This specialization allows for mutual gains for the people of trading countries.
Increased trade and specialization may benefit some groups within a country while harming others, for example, those producing goods that compete with imports.
When evaluating government policy and international agreements, we may look at whether they fully exploit the mutual gains made possible, distribute those gains fairly, and reduce the economic insecurities involved in the globalization process.

In December 1899, the steamship Manila docked in Genoa, Italy, and offloaded her cargo of grain grown in India. The Suez Canal had opened 30years earlier, slashing the cost of moving agricultural commodities from south Asia to European markets. Italian bakers and shoppers were delighted at the low prices. Italian farmers were not. After a couple of months in Genoa, the Manila headed west. She carried 69 people in steerage (the cheapest possible passage), who were abandoning their homeland in search of a livelihood in the US.
The low prices were made possible by a revolution in transportation and farming technology. As with the opening of the Suez Canal, the expansion of the railway system to the fields of North America, the Russian plain and northern India, and the development of steam-powered ships like the Manila, had cut the cost of transporting grain to distant markets. Across the vast plains of the American midwest, new strains of wheat, newly developed reapers and sowers, and improved drainage technologies had created a hi-tech, capital-intensive form of farming that was as productive as anywhere in the world.

tariffA tax on a good imported into a country.

Across Europe, parliaments and state bodies struggled to adjust to the grain price shock. In France and Germany, farmers and their advocates prevailed. Despite the benefits of lower grain prices to families, and despite the protests of workers who consumed the grain, governments imposed tariffs to protect the incomes of farmers.
Denmark, among other countries, responded differently. Instead of protecting grain farmers from cheap imports, the government helped them to start dairy farming instead. Using cheap imported grain as an input, farmers responded to the incentives to produce milk, cheese, and other commodities that could not be transported cheaply over long distances. In turn, cheaper grain meant families could increase spending on these dairy products.
In Italy, the children of some farmers took up jobs in the booming textile industry, which was exporting to the rest of the world. Many bankrupted farmers made the trip to the US. They slept on the decks of empty freighters that were returning to the US to pick up grain for Europe. About 750,000 Europeans made this voyage each year during the decade after the Manilas visit to Genoa. Some of their grandchildren would end up as American farmers, growing grain in Kansas.
In the European Union, the Common Agricultural Policy seeks to protect the agricultural sector for member countries. In the US, the most recent legislation supporting the sector is The Agricultural Act of 2014, known as The Farm Bill.
There were big winners and big losers from the grain price shock. Many of the changes made economic sense. For example, the worlds grain was now grown increasingly in places where it could be produced most efficiently. But tariffs designed to protect the farmers of Germany and France held back this reallocation, preventing owners and workers in other sectors of the economy from enjoying lower grain prices. This continues to this dayrich countries still commonly protect their agricultural sectors through subsidies.

globalizationA process by which the economies of the world become increasingly integrated by the freer flow across national boundaries of goods, investment, finance, and to a lesser extent, labour. The term is sometimes applied more broadly to include ideas, culture, and even the spread of epidemic diseases.offshoringThe relocation of part of a firms activities outside of the national boundaries in which it operates. It can take place within a multinational company or may involve outsourcing production to other firms.

The battle line was not between rich and poor, or landlords and tenants, or employers and employees. The conflict was between the producers of different commodities. Those involved in manufacturing welcomed the expansion of trade with the US, while those farming grain did not.
Globalization is the word commonly used to describe our increasingly interconnected world. This term refers not only to the trade in grain and migration across national borders illustrated by the Manila, but also to non-economic aspects of international integration, such as the International Criminal Court, the flow of ideas across borders, or our increasingly similar taste in music.
In Unit 6, we looked at firms like Apple that choose to produce their goods in other parts of the world where costs are lower. This offshoring is an important dimension of globalization, and it can involve outsourcing production to other companies, or it can take place within the boundaries of a multinational company. For example, Figure 18.1 shows that the Ford Motor Company operates offices or plants in 22 countries outside the US. The company started offshoring a year after it was founded, first in Canada in 1904, and began manufacturing in many other countries soon afterwards, for example in Australia (1925) and even the Soviet Union (1930). In 2016 this American company had 201,000 employees, 144,000 of them located outside the US.

In the case of a multinational company, owners, managers and employees in many countries have become part of the same unified, transnational structure. This is because the costs of doing business within the company are lower than the costs of doing business with other companies. But, as we saw with the cotton market in Units 8 and 11, globalization not only involves the integration of firms in different countries; it involves the integration of markets themselves, bringing sellers and buyers in different countries closer together.
You have already learned the basic concepts that you need to understand the global economy:

Exchange involves the possibility of mutual gains and also conflicts over how these gains will be distributed.
The resulting outcomes may not be Pareto efficient (there may be technically feasible mutual gains that remain unrealized).
The resulting distribution may seem unfair in the eyes of many.
Well-designed government policies can improve the efficiency or fairness of the outcomes.

While this is true of any set of market exchanges, when goods, services, people, and financial assets cross national boundaries, governments have additional powers and policies that include:

Imposition of tariffs: These are taxes on imports that effectively discriminate against goods produced in other countries.
Immigration policies: Governments regulate the movement of people between nations in a way that would not be possible (or acceptable) within most nations.
Capital controls: Limits on the ability of individuals or firms to transfer financial assets among countries.
Monetary policies: They affect the exchange rate, and so alter the relative prices of imported and exported goods.

While national boundaries give governments additional policy tools, they also limit the reach of governments. Within a nation, governments generally succeed in protecting private property rights where these exist, and in enforcing contracts. Because there is no world government (and international agencies are often weak), enforcing contracts and protecting property rights globally is sometimes impossible.
This raises controversial questions about the fairness of the distribution of mutual gains from exchange. The conflicting interests sometimes coincide with national differences between poorer and richer economies. It is tempting, though often inaccurate as we will see, to consider these conflicts as us at home versus them abroad.
In this unit, we will consider three markets that became more integrated with globalization: international markets for goods and services (trade), international labour markets (migration), and international capital markets (international capital flows, which are flows of savings and investment).
